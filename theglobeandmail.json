Even more importantly, promise that you won\u2019t get angry with yourself if you fail to live up to that promise."}, {"text": "Chances are you will get exactly what you want during the first few days of the year. The only problem is that what you want may be what other people don\u2019t want you to have. So what? Take it anyway \u2013 they can\u2019t stop you."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that 2019 is going to be the year when the position you occupy in the world changes for the better. Set your sights high, on the career front especially, then be ready to go higher still. For you Cancer, there are no limits!"}, {"text": "Do something creative today, something that enables you to get rid of all that excess energy that has been building up. This is also a great time to plan your next vacation, even if you can\u2019t take it until later in the year. Go somewhere exotic."}, {"text": "Too often of late you have argued with friends and family for no good reason and that is something you need to deal with. Where joint activities are concerned either make allowances for other people\u2019s inadequacies or resolve to go it alone."}, {"text": "How you react to people on the first day of the year will to a large extent determine how well your relationships develop in the first half of 2019. Always look for compromise solutions, even when you are convinced that your way is best."}, {"text": "You have no reason to be sad about what has gone out of your life because something even better is on its way to you now. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start doing the things that will make you happy. Your destiny is in your own hands."}, {"text": "Start something new today, something that inspires you to be better than you have ever been before. A part of you may doubt that you are up to the task but that part must be ignored. There is nothing you cannot do if you put your mind to it."}, {"text": "If someone does something that annoys you today don\u2019t just shrug it off or pretend that you don\u2019t really care. What you do today will colour the entire year to come, so be assertive and make sure it\u2019s your voice that gets heard."}, {"text": "You need to make a bit more noise \u2013 in fact you need to make a lot more noise. Yes, of course, everyone has opinions but your opinions are more valuable than most in that a lot more thought has gone into them. The world needs your voice."}, {"text": "Money matters of one kind or another will be top of your agenda as the new year begins, and with Mars moving into the main financial area of your chart you won\u2019t be all talk and no action.

Hopefully your stubborn resistance will work but, if it doesn\u2019t, just accept that some people will always be more powerful than you."}, {"text": "You are in an adventurous mood at the moment, which is great, but don\u2019t take unnecessary risks. If you expose yourself to situations that could in some way turn dangerous you will have no one to blame but yourself if you get hurt."}, {"text": "The only thing to fear is fear itself and you need to keep telling yourself that fact over and over again until it finally lodges in your mind. Don\u2019t worry that something you attempt might go wrong \u2013 worry only that you are too scared to try."}, {"text": "Make sure you know what you are talking about today because if you say things that cannot be backed up by facts someone who does know their stuff could make you look silly. It\u2019s no shame to admit that you don\u2019t know it all."}, {"text": "You have more talent in your big toe than the average person has in their entire body, but according to the planets you are not using it. Get your act together over the next few days and get started on something that really inspires you."}, {"text": "You will try to hide your feelings today but chances are you won\u2019t succeed. Something has annoyed you to such an extent that you can\u2019t help but get emotional about it. That\u2019s good \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous to hold on to negative feelings."}, {"text": "Try not to be too aggressive today, even if your anger is justified.

It may take a while for them to forgive you."}, {"text": "You will do something above and beyond the call of duty over the next 24 hours, but chances are you won\u2019t get much praise for it. But that\u2019s okay. You are not in the business of helping people just so you can bask in glory yourself."}, {"text": "You may feel trapped by your obligations but the planets warn there is nothing you can do to escape them just yet. What you can do, of course, is change your attitude and do what you have to do with a smile on your face. It always helps!"}, {"text": "With sun power and Saturn power both on your side there is nothing you cannot do if you put your mind to it. For best results just stick with a well-defined plan and don\u2019t push yourself too hard. Small steps will take you where you need to go."}, {"text": "You certainly don\u2019t lack for advice at the moment \u2013 everyone and their dog seems to know what you need to do! Don\u2019t listen to a word of it. You already know what is best for you personally \u2013 your inner voice told you long ago."}, {"text": "If what you have to tell a friend or family member hurts their feelings don\u2019t feel bad about it. Someone needs to let them know what they are doing wrong and it would appear that someone has to be you. They\u2019ll thank you one day."}, {"text": "What is it that you expect of yourself? What is it that drives you? You need to identify those things clearly in your mind, then you need to do whatever it takes to make a success of them. Make that your overriding ambition this year."}, {"text": "Something will happen today that makes you realize how much more is possible if you really put your mind to it. On the career front, especially, you will get at least one and maybe several opportunities to showcase your talents. Don\u2019t waste them."}, {"text": "If you need to get away from your usual environment then start making plans and don\u2019t stop until you have booked yourself a vacation in some place exotic. The planets indicate that the further you travel the more you will enjoy it, so get going."}, {"text": "Be warned Gemini: While you are trying to find out what other people are up to they could be digging around in things that you would rather keep hidden. If you want your personal affairs to remain personal you may need to change your passwords!"}, {"text": "You cannot be top dog every day of the week and with the sun moving through your opposite sign the simple fact is you will have to follow while others lead.

Maybe, but more likely they just enjoy being in your company and basking in the aura of your golden personality. You should feel flattered Leo."}, {"text": "This is the ideal time to start something creative or artistic, something that will not only engage you physically, mentally and emotionally, but could pay off financially too at some point in the future. Good art is worth paying for!"}, {"text": "If there have been any minor disputes or disagreements on the home front of late now is the time to sit down and sort them out.

Your powers of persuasion are always formidable but they are about to become unbeatable \u2013 no one will want to deny you."}, {"text": "This is your time of year, a time when all things are possible if you want them enough. But it is also possible to go over the top and do too much, both for yourself and for other people. Draw up a sensible plan and stick to it."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get much done today \u2013 chances are the aims and deadlines you set for yourself were both unnecessary and unreasonable and can be safely ignored. You won\u2019t lose out if you take it easy up to and including the weekend."}, {"text": "The planets warn you can no longer rely on other people to come to your rescue if you go too far or spend too much. The fact that you have grown used to someone being there to catch you when you fall isn\u2019t helpful, and could even be dangerous."}, {"text": "The spiritual side of life will interest you over the coming 12 months and you may even join an organization or movement that links you to a higher power. Once you have this anchor in your life many other things will fall into place."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to end a project that has begun to bore you but don\u2019t be too hasty. According to the planets if you stick with it a bit longer your interest in it will grow again. And your profits from it will grow, too."}, {"text": "You will need to push your ego to one side today and do something that a friend told you to do a while ago but which you decided to ignore. So they were right and you were wrong \u2013 it\u2019s no big deal. No one is perfect, not even Taurus!"}, {"text": "A relationship that has been going through a tough time will get better for both of you over the next few days, so start smiling again and start believing that you can make a go of it. The fact that you think that way makes it more likely."}, {"text": "The issues you are struggling with are not that difficult at all \u2013 it\u2019s only your negative attitude that makes them appear bigger than they actually are. Stand back from yourself and see life from a wider perspective \u2013 it will makes things so much easier."}, {"text": "Cut back on your commitments a bit and try doing fewer things for other people. Yes, of course, that\u2019s a bit selfish but there are only so many hours in the day and you have plenty of your own stuff to get on with. Do that first."}, {"text": "What other people want is irrelevant \u2013 it\u2019s what you want that counts. At this time of year while there is so much cosmic activity in your fellow earth sign of Capricorn you need to be focused exclusively on your own aims and ambitions."}, {"text": "A solution to a problem you have been grappling with mentally for ages will start to take shape in your mind today. Before long you will be taking the kind of action that you should have taken towards the end of last year. Still, better late than never."}, {"text": "You must do whatever it takes to keep your thoughts positive, even if there are a dozen and one things going on in your life that make you want to scream. Business matters, in particular, are best dealt with in a light-hearted manner. It\u2019s only money!"}, {"text": "Try not to take anything too seriously today or over the weekend, because if you focus your mind too strongly in one direction you could miss out on some really interesting things. Your luck will turn quicker than you expected it to, so be ready."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to feel this vulnerable, so what\u2019s the matter? Most likely it is just the last hurrah from mind planet Mercury in the most introspective area of your chart. As from tomorrow your thoughts \u2013 and your outlook generally \u2013 will soar again."}, {"text": "A friend will say something distinctly hostile today and you\u2019ll be shocked to say the least. What did you do to offend them? Nothing at all, most likely \u2013 it\u2019s just that they are going through a tough time at the moment and they\u2019re a little highly-strung."}, {"text": "Others may say that you have bitten off more than you can chew but the planets indicate that your capacity for hard work is much higher than most of them are aware. Do something out of the ordinary today. Stun those who doubt you."}, {"text": "You will find your voice over the coming year, and some of the things you come out with will amaze not just other people but yourself as well. There\u2019s a lot you have been bottling up inside. It will feel good to release it all at last."}, {"text": "Mercury moves into the career area of your chart today, which means you are going to be thinking seriously about your work and reputation. You don\u2019t have to make any major decisions yet though \u2013 tomorrow\u2019s eclipse will point you in the right direction."}, {"text": "A little more curiosity about the world around you will do you no harm at all this weekend. There are so many things you have missed out on because you didn\u2019t even know about them. Time to find out what\u2019s going on in the world."}, {"text": "The planets are trying to make you aware that you have been worrying about your money situation for no good reason. The good news is that over the next few days you will see solutions where before you saw only problems. That\u2019s cause for celebration."}, {"text": "Do you get involved in a fight or feud that is really none of your business, or do you keep your distance? You know the answer to that one already, so why are you even thinking about it? If it\u2019s not your problem, stay well away."}, {"text": "Start thinking about ways you can reduce your workload in general and your everyday household chores in particular. You may not be able to make any major changes for a week or so but you can at least make a few plans. It\u2019s a start."}, {"text": "A positive attitude always brings positive results and both in your personal life and at work people will sense your self-assurance and want to get close to you and do things for you. Artistic activities are under excellent stars \u2013 so create something."}, {"text": "You may like to think that you are always self-sufficient but the fact is you need help occasionally just like everyone else. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for assistance if you need it this weekend. You may be surprised how quickly and positively people respond."}, {"text": "Mercury\u2019s move into the communications area of your chart today will make it easier for you to express yourself \u2013 and easier for others to understand what you are trying to say. There is no such thing as poor communication \u2013 not this weekend anyway."}, {"text": "News received from afar will cheer you up immensely today, and could even lead to you making some money. Don\u2019t share what you learn with other people, keep it to yourself and make sure you are the one who sees most of the benefits."}, {"text": "Everything is falling into place now and with mind planet Mercury joining the sun in your sign you will know in an instant this weekend what is right and what is wrong and what needs to be done to make more of the gifts you were born with."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that you will withdraw into your shell this weekend and spend time thinking about the deeper meaning of your existence. That might sound a bit heavy but you have always been a seeker after truth. Maybe it\u2019s about time you found it."}, {"text": "This is the perfect time to get together with friends and do something of a social nature together. Forget about work for a while and focus on having fun. Remember, if it does not make you smile then chances are it\u2019s not right for you."}, {"text": "You possess no end of talent but you don\u2019t always use it as effectively as you should, and that needs to change. What gift has the universe bestowed on you? Take it, polish it and use it to help your fellow man \u2013 and maybe make yourself a few dollars too."}, {"text": "You will enjoy no end of opportunities to make your mark during the early part of the year but with so many options available you need to choose carefully. List your priorities, identify your No.1 goal, then go for it with everything you\u2019ve got."}, {"text": "You will learn something new about a situation that caused you some worry last year, and the news will bring a smile to your face. Most likely there was precious little to get worked up about in the first place, and now you know that the fun can begin."}, {"text": "Keep things simple and don\u2019t let your mind be lured away from what is important by people and activities that look interesting but won\u2019t take you closer to your goals. Also, if you are given something for free you will be expected to give something back."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be surprised if what happens over the next few days feels like the kind of situation you have been through many times before. The difference this time though is that the consequences of your actions will be multiplied a hundredfold \u2013 so take it seriously."}, {"text": "Make where you are going to your guiding star, and let where you have come from fade into the past. Find ways to reinvent yourself before the year gets any older Leo. What is your most amazing dream or your deepest desire? Go for it right now."}, {"text": "Too much thinking is rarely a good thing, so put your brain in neutral for a bit and let circumstances guide you. There is a plan to your life that is becoming, bit by bit, easier to see. You will find it for sure once you stop looking so hard."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in one of the more touchy areas of your chart means you will be in an emotional frame of mind this week. Do not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 allow your feelings to get the better of you. Whatever the provocation you must rise above it. Be better than your critics."}, {"text": "If others want to waste their time on trivial activities then let them get on with it. The planets indicate you are going to have a number of important things to take care of over the next few days, so leave the small stuff to little people."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the main financial area of your chart will do wonders for your cash-flow situation over the next few weeks but you still need to be careful. Any money you make should be put aside for the proverbial rainy day \u2013 it may be here quite soon!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in your sign is so intense at the moment that you may be worrying how you are going to keep on top of everything that happens. But you will. Capricorn is a sign that possesses hidden reserves, and you will be calling on them this week."}, {"text": "If you keep your eyes and ears open over the next few days you may discover something about the world around you, something that answers some of the deeper questions you have been asking yourself. Yes, there is meaning to life. Can you work out what it is?"}, {"text": "You know on a mental level that there is no point thinking too much about the past, still less worrying about it. But it would appear there is something you just can\u2019t let go of. Face up to it once and for all and then leave it behind you forever."}, {"text": "Charity work of one sort or another will attract you over the coming year. You may seem material by nature but there is a deeper part of you that wants to be of service to the world. You will find that helping others helps you a great deal, too."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much about work as the new week begins. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your fellow fire sign of Sagittarius today you will get more out of life if you relax rather than push yourself too hard. You\u2019ve earned a break."}, {"text": "You can and you must follow your heart this coming week, no matter where it might lead you nor what others might say about what you choose to do. It\u2019s not about success or making money, it\u2019s about being happy in your own skin."}, {"text": "Do something that makes a difference for a friend or family member today, something that improves their life in a clear and enjoyable way. If you show others love and respect now they will return the favour many times over later on."}, {"text": "You will find it hard to get excited about chores and other responsibilities as the new week begins, but that\u2019s okay. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the work area of your chart you can probably afford to slack off a bit, or maybe a lot."}, {"text": "Others may say you are not taking things seriously enough, and maybe they\u2019re right, but so what? Life is too short to allow yourself to get agitated over issues that, a month, a week, maybe only a day from now won\u2019t matter in the slightest."}, {"text": "If a friend gives you some rather personal advice today it may annoy you that they think they can say things about your private life without being asked. On the other hand, what they tell you could be helpful. Maybe you should listen."}, {"text": "You seem to be remarkably tolerant at the moment. Are you not feeling well? Most likely you are feeling very well indeed, thanks to Venus, your ruler, moving into one of the more relaxed areas of your chart. Why get angry when you don\u2019t have to?"}, {"text": "There is no point making a big issue out of a money matter that did not work out the way you wanted it to. There will be another chance to earn more cash later in the week, so put this one down to experience and move on."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of love and harmony, moves into your sign today, so chances are you will be in an easygoing and forgiving sort of mood. But if someone has wronged you don\u2019t just forgive without getting something in return. An apology would be nice."}, {"text": "The most important thing over the coming week is that you keep your own standards high and that you make sure those you have dealings with, on both a personal and a professional level, keep their standards high too. Only the best is good enough."}, {"text": "You may be having second thoughts about a way of looking at the world that you once took for granted, but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good that you are showing some flexibility in your thinking. You can sometimes be a bit too rigid for your own good."}, {"text": "You will be in one of your more generous moods today and anyone who asks you a favour is likely to find it granted. Just be careful you don\u2019t give away too much of your time and energy, and even more so your money, and leave yourself short."}, {"text": "Try not to take anything or anyone too seriously this year. Too often in the past you have allowed minor matters to balloon into major issues, but this year you need to reverse that way of thinking. Treat everything that happens as a bit of a joke."}, {"text": "What you say today is sure to sound unreasonable to . . . well, just about everyone. Will that stop you from saying it? Of course not. You\u2019re an Aries and you really don\u2019t care what other people think about you. Hopefully you won\u2019t lose too many friends."}, {"text": "Your air of self-confidence is such that almost everyone you meet today will want to do things for you. It just seems right that whatever it is you ask for someone will rush to get it for you. By all means take advantage of the situation!"}, {"text": "The message of the stars for you at the moment is that you need to recognize that happiness comes not from having what you want but from wanting what you have. And the fact is you already have more than enough to satisfy your needs."}, {"text": "If you know your own mind then what you accomplish over the next two or three days will amaze everyone, including yourself. But if you haven\u2019t yet decided what you want to achieve then give it some thought right now. There\u2019s still time."}, {"text": "Fate is pointing you in a certain direction and you won\u2019t need telling twice that if you go in that direction something pretty good will happen. The only downside is that you will probably have to go on your own. Few people share your vision."}, {"text": "What you expect to happen over the next 24 hours won\u2019t happen \u2013 and what you don\u2019t expect to happen will happen. Should that worry you? Not in the slightest. Virgo is one of the most flexible signs of the zodiac. You\u2019ll adapt and thrive."}, {"text": "With Mars and Mercury at right angles today there is every possibility that you will say something that no one else gets. Is it because you have not made yourself clear, or because others are not up to understanding? It\u2019s the latter, of course."}, {"text": "You may have fixed opinions about certain issues but if you think you can convince people through sheer force of personality to agree with you then you are going to be disappointed. Stick to the facts and let others decide for themselves."}, {"text": "Flattery will get you everywhere today \u2013 but watch out you don\u2019t end up some place you did not really want to go! If you get carried away with your own powers of persuasion you could easily convince yourself of something that isn\u2019t true."}, {"text": "With communications planet Mercury at odds with Mars, planet of anger, today there is a real possibility that you will overreact to provocation and say something you later regret. Try to remember that, whatever happens, you\u2019re only human. And humans are far from perfect. "}, {"text": "Common sense should be telling you that certain routines and methods are not working as well as you hoped they would, but being the kind of person who hates admitting that you got something wrong you will no doubt persevere \u2013 for good or ill."}, {"text": "No doubt you are in the mood to make changes and no doubt you are right to want to do so, but don\u2019t be hasty and start swapping things around before you are ready. You will instinctively know when to make your big move \u2013 soon but not yet."}, {"text": "You may wish you were the kind of person who loves the world and everyone in it but face facts, that\u2019s not you at all. The message of your birthday chart is that you must be true to your nature over the coming 12 months. Nothing else matters."}, {"text": "By all means look for ways to escape circumstances that are holding you back but be aware that some of them may actually be holding you up! What you escape from in the short-term may not be what you want to escape from in the long-term."}, {"text": "You have been given far too many choices of late and it has at times confused you. Now, however, you feel limited in your options and wish you had a few more. Try to realize it\u2019s not the choices you are given that matter but the choices you make. "}, {"text": "It might be an idea to take it easy today, either because you have pushed yourself a bit too hard of late or because you are not feeling 100 per cent physically. Start slowly and build up steam only when, and if, you feel like it."}, {"text": "You seem to be in two minds whether to get more deeply involved with a group of people you quite like but whose aims are not really your aims. For the moment at least, make no kind of commitment. Time will point you in the right direction."}, {"text": "Lady Luck is smiling on you now and all your dreams are about to come true. Well, okay, maybe it\u2019s not quite as good as that, but if you act as if you cannot lose then it\u2019s highly unlikely you will. Your thoughts create your reality."}, {"text": "If you have been getting the silent treatment from a friend or family member in recent days it\u2019s most likely because you have offended them with your critical comments. Don\u2019t waste your time trying to apologize \u2013 they\u2019ll get over themselves eventually."}, {"text": "The more you are on the move and meeting people today the more you will enjoy yourself. You might learn a thing or two worth knowing as well. Don\u2019t sit at home in front of the TV \u2013 get out into the world and have some fun."}, {"text": "If you feel the need to question your priorities this is probably as good a time as any to take a look at your life and think seriously about what changes might need to be made. And once you\u2019ve decided, go all out to be a better person."}, {"text": "No doubt there are some things you would like a little less of, and some things you would like a little more of, but if you are honest you will admit that, like baby bear\u2019s porridge, your life is just about perfect at the moment. So enjoy it!"}, {"text": "If you feel that you are not being taken seriously enough by the people you work with or for, don\u2019t worry \u2013 between now and the weekend you will get the chance to shine and there will be just no way they can ignore your talents."}, {"text": "The problem you are having so much trouble with actually has an easy answer, but you are unlikely to find it until you let your mind relax and let the universe send you the information you need. You don\u2019t have to be so serious about everything Aquarius."}, {"text": "The next few days are going to be of considerable importance to you and by the time the weekend arrives you should have made some far-reaching decisions. The most important thing is that once you have made those decisions you stick with them."}, {"text": "Do you know what it is you want from life? And do you have a plan that will take you, step by step, from where you are now to where you most want to be? It\u2019s time to get serious about your existence, not once but every single day."}, {"text": "There\u2019s this nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you have left something undone, maybe something of major importance. If you can\u2019t think what it is then think about something completely unrelated and let your subconscious work it out for you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if you find it hard to get along with someone today \u2013 either you or they are going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment, which makes one-to-one relationships a touch more difficult than usual. You\u2019ll both get over it."}, {"text": "It might be a smart move to cut back on social activities over the next 24 to 48 hours. There\u2019s a lot coming up at the weekend and you need to be fresh for what happens then. Even a Gemini needs to conserve their energy once in a while."}, {"text": "You may not want to cut back on luxuries but you know you have to, if only to stop yourself getting even further in debt. Try a new philosophy of life \u2013 try living on as little as you possibly can, at least for the next few days."}, {"text": "You can come across a bit loud and aggressive at times and the planets warn if you go over the top today it may be weeks before you can get things back to normal with people you love. You don\u2019t have to shout to make yourself heard. "}, {"text": "Something is about to happen that disrupts the way you look at the world and it may even force you to question some of your most deeply-held beliefs. It may not be a comfortable experience but it will do you a lot of good \u2013 if you let it."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t feel too bad about it if you have to pull out of a social event either today or tomorrow. Yes, it will cause a certain amount of friction with those you\u2019ve let down but your own needs must come first. If they\u2019re smart they\u2019ll understand that. "}, {"text": "You may be having second thoughts about something that up until recently was one of the pillars of your existence. According to the planets you don\u2019t need to junk it completely, you just need to make some adjustments. Discover your passion again."}, {"text": "If you have been aiming too high in one or more areas of your life you will have to come down to earth again over the next few days. It\u2019s one thing to have an amazing flight of fancy but quite another to expect it to come true."}, {"text": "Someone who has helped you in the past won\u2019t be able to help you now, not because they don\u2019t want to but because they don\u2019t possess what you need. And what is that? Just the confidence to be who you want to be. Only you can get it."}, {"text": "Something in your life appears to be moving in the opposite direction to where you want it to go and you cannot quite work out what you need to do to turn it around. Maybe you\u2019re not meant to. Maybe it\u2019s the right way for you."}, {"text": "Even if you have fallen behind in your workload you must not push yourself too hard in an effort to catch up. Somehow or other it will all get done in the end \u2013 it always does \u2013 so stop fretting and do something you enjoy (and it\u2019s not work)."}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link on your birthday endows you with almost limitless amounts of energy \u2013 and not just any old energy but the sort that is backed up by tremendous desire. Can one single person change the world for the better? They can if they\u2019re you!"}, {"text": "Powerful cosmic forces are now gathered in the career area of your chart, which means you are determined to do something out of the ordinary on the work front. Don\u2019t just think big, think \u2013 and act \u2013 on an out-of-this-world level."}, {"text": "This would be a good time to begin something that exercises your mind and broadens your horizons. If there is a subject you are interested in you should try looking at it in more depth today. What you discover will excite and enlighten you."}, {"text": "Something of a financial nature needs to be dealt with immediately \u2013 not tomorrow or the day after that, but right now, this very minute. Where joint resources are concerned you must get smart and make sure you are not being cheated."}, {"text": "Partners and colleagues will be even more demanding than usual today and if you lose your temper it won\u2019t be much of a surprise. You\u2019ll be friends again tomorrow, of course, but for the next 24 hours expect some emotional fireworks."}, {"text": "You would be the first to admit that some of your recent efforts have not been up to your usual high standards, but don\u2019t get hung up about it. Today\u2019s sun-Pluto link will help you find the way back to the place you should be \u2013 the top."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most creative area of your chart demands that you set your sights high and recognize that, for you at this moment in time and space, the possibilities are endless. Aim to be the very best \u2013 then do even better."}, {"text": "Someone you are emotionally connected to needs your help and, of course, you will do what you can to assist them. But make sure they are not taking advantage of you. Some days Libra you can be too generous for your own good."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s link to Pluto in the communications area of your chart means you are sure to say something that annoys, well, just about everyone. Will that bother you? Not in the slightest. You\u2019re in one of those moods where you just don\u2019t care."}, {"text": "If you need to do something drastic about your cash-flow situation then now is the time. Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart makes it easy for you to take action to reduce the gap between what you own and what you earn."}, {"text": "There is so much power in your sign now that if you can find ways to use it in constructive ways you will accomplish not just good things but great things. To say you have potential is not saying nearly enough. The world is at your feet."}, {"text": "You may feel sorry for a friend who is in a bit of a state but don\u2019t waste time trying to help them. This is one of those situations where they have to find their own solutions. You can\u2019t always be there to catch them when they fall."}, {"text": "If you make time for friendships and group activities today you will thoroughly enjoy yourself. The more you do with other people the more you will feel that you are making a difference in the world. You can be a force for good Pisces."}, {"text": "A Mercury-Saturn link on your birthday suggests you will be wrestling with some of the more serious issues of life this year. You can still have fun \u2013 of course \u2013 but you cannot avoid the big questions. Look for answers and you will find them."}, {"text": "Try to keep your more negative thoughts to yourself this weekend, because they won\u2019t go down well with friends and family members who want to have fun. No doubt there are things that need seeing to, but they don\u2019t have to be dealt with right now."}, {"text": "What you hear on the grapevine today may sound true but the planets warn you should treat the information with caution. Unless you enjoy taking risks with your money and reputation you would be wise not to believe everything you hear."}, {"text": "There is so much you can accomplish now \u2013 if you have faith in yourself. It\u2019s common for you at this time of year to believe that your options are limited but they\u2019re not. It\u2019s your mind that creates your world, so be positive."}, {"text": "You will come up with all sorts of weird and wonderful ideas over the next 48 hours, and not a single one of them will be grounded in reality. It\u2019s one thing to fantasize about life, but quite another to expect those fantasies to come true."}, {"text": "If you feel the need to spend some time by yourself today then just do so \u2013 you don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s permission. Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts and with luck you\u2019ll find an answer to your problems."}, {"text": "If you find yourself stuck in a situation where the people around you are a bit dull and depressing then make your excuses and leave.

Put your own needs first."}, {"text": "Someone you usually consider to be a friend will say something you profoundly disagree with this weekend and there could be a major falling-out as a result. Tell yourself now that whatever you hear, you won\u2019t take it too seriously. It might help."}, {"text": "Promise yourself here and now that you are going to have a wonderful weekend and that you won\u2019t let anyone spoil it. Mercury\u2019s link to Saturn means someone will most likely try to rain on your parade but they can only succeed if you let them."}, {"text": "You must get serious about your money situation this weekend. If you keep flashing cash as if it has no intrinsic worth you could find yourself in a bad position financially toward the end of next week. You don\u2019t have to buy everything you see."}, {"text": "Think hard about what you intend to do next but don\u2019t actually do it, at least not yet. The planets warn if you act on impulse over the next 48 hours you could end up paying for it over the next 48 days! Control your desires."}, {"text": "You seem to have a lot of mental energy at your disposal at the moment, which is good, but are you channelling it into positive things? You need to get over your tendency to believe that the world will end just because one little thing goes wrong."}, {"text": "Arrange your timetable carefully for the next 48 hours, especially if you are the type of Pisces who tends to just do things as and when the feeling takes you. If you don\u2019t have a plan this weekend you could end up in a major muddle."}, {"text": "The coming 12 months will bring all sorts of challenges and looking back a year or so from now you may wonder how you got through them all. But you will in fact triumph and show others what a truly tough cookie you are. They won\u2019t doubt you again!"}, {"text": "You may not be much in the mood for work but if you ask for assistance from a friend or colleague you should be able to get through the day without too much effort. You don\u2019t want this negative mood to last though, so snap out of it quickly."}, {"text": "There has been a bit of a negative atmosphere at work of late and you need to do something about it. If you have issues with a colleague then you must confront them head-on. Those issues certainly won\u2019t resolve themselves of their own accord."}, {"text": "Everyone makes mistakes, yes even Geminis, so stop pretending that you got something right when all the evidence suggests that you got it wrong. In the greater scheme of things it is of only limited importance, so why bother trying to deny it?"}, {"text": "Finding the words to describe how you feel may not be easy but it is worth the effort, not least because once others know where you are coming from emotionally they are more likely to adjust their actions to help you. Remember, they can\u2019t read your mind."}, {"text": "There is nothing you cannot do in this life, no goal that is beyond you. You may need to remind yourself of that fact on a number of occasions today as it will be easy to let negativity take over. Identify your number one priority and go for it."}, {"text": "As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your opposite sign today you should find that worries about partnerships and relationships ease a bit. They would, of course, ease a lot more if you could teach yourself to stop taking life quite so seriously."}, {"text": "Stand back from all the confusing things that are going on around you and try to make a rational decision about what you need to do to bring a bit of stability back to your affairs. You could start by not being quite so intense on the work front."}, {"text": "You may be individualistic by nature but if you want to do great things in life then you will need to work with other people. Something of a creative nature would certainly benefit from more outside input, so don\u2019t be too proud to ask for advice."}, {"text": "One way or another you will get what it is that you need, but you will get it sooner, and enjoy it more, if you use flattery rather than force when dealing with other people. On the home front, especially, try overlooking loved ones\u2019 failings \u2013 like they overlook yours!"}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s links to Saturn and Pluto in your sign today suggest that the next few days will in some way be make or break for you. You are more likely to get a positive result if you allow your heart to guide you. Love life, don\u2019t dread it."}, {"text": "You have been worrying so much in recent weeks that now the consequences you feared are upon you it will come as a relief to get them over with. The good news is that they are unlikely to be anywhere near as bad as you persuaded yourself to believe."}, {"text": "As Venus moves into your sign today a kind of calm will descend on you and all those things you have been worrying about will no longer matter. Attitude is everything, and if you can keep such a positive outlook going then you truly have nothing to fear."}, {"text": "Your imagination will be working overtime this year and if you can find ways to channel your ideas into creative activities there\u2019s no telling what you might achieve. Trust your instincts before you trust other people \u2013 they won\u2019t let you down."}, {"text": "Make sure you are on the move and meeting people over the next few days because one-to-one interaction and the swapping of ideas will help you considerably. There is also a possibility that you will meet someone new to love."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let those who say you are behaving illogically persuade you to change your ways. You know what you are doing and if others are too dumb to understand it that\u2019s their problem, not yours. Besides, you\u2019ve never been one to listen to advice."}, {"text": "With Mercury, your ruling planet, aligned with Neptune today you are advised not to do anything too physical or energetic. And where your mind is concerned try listening to the voice behind all the other voices \u2013 the one that comes from deep within."}, {"text": "If you admit that you need help today you will most likely be overwhelmed by offers of assistance. You have done so many good deeds for other people in the past that they will now jump at the chance of doing something for you. Let them."}, {"text": "A new partnership or relationship could begin either today or tomorrow and no matter what form it takes one thing is certain \u2013 it will be a lot of fun. Also, if you get the chance, try doing some charity or voluntary work. You\u2019ll enjoy it."}, {"text": "If you go out of your way to be nice to people today they will go out of their way to be nice to you in return and the world will suddenly seem a better place. Your kindness will have a knock-on effect: good deeds go on forever."}, {"text": "Your generosity knows no bounds at the moment \u2013 you want to help people in any way you can. That\u2019s extremely good of you but don\u2019t forget that there are only so many hours in the day and your energy is not unlimited, so prioritize."}, {"text": "Usually you manage to keep the intensity of your emotions well hidden but over the coming week you will find it increasingly difficult to disguise what you feel. Maybe that\u2019s no bad thing, maybe it\u2019s time that you let it all out. Start today."}, {"text": "Try to patch up any minor disputes you may have with loved ones. You will find it easier than usual to admit that you were partly to blame for what went wrong, which in turn will make it easier for them to admit they were less than perfect too."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to find it hard to make up your mind but Mercury\u2019s link to Neptune as the new week begins suggests you have doubts about what to do next. You don\u2019t need to make an immediate decision. Sleep on it tonight."}, {"text": "The message of the stars for you as the new week begins is that you must be patient and let fate take its course. A week from now the sun will be in your sign and a whole new ballgame will be underway. Until then, keep a low profile."}, {"text": "Forget about career and financial issues and focus on your family. You seem to have lost a bit of perspective in recent weeks and now you need to remind yourself of what matters and what does not. People matter, not things. Remember that."}, {"text": "The coming year will be a time of great activity and while you may not always be at the center of events you must get involved and you must get your ideas across to the people who can help you to put them to good \u2013 and, hopefully, profitable use."}, {"text": "There is something you want to say but for some reason cannot find the right words to convey your meaning. Don\u2019t worry about it. Your body language speaks volumes and those around you will know without being told what it is you expect of them."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority will make you an interesting offer between now and the end of the week and if you are smart you will take it. It may be quite a while before you get this good an opportunity again. Strive to make it work."}, {"text": "It won\u2019t be long before you get a bit more assertive but for now you are strongly advised to stay in the background and not call attention to yourself. If others don\u2019t know you are there they cannot make life difficult for you!"}, {"text": "Your current predicament is not due to anything you have done personally, and it certainly is not due to the universe punishing you for your sins, so get past the idea that you are to blame and sort the situation out calmly and logically."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have been moving in the wrong direction for a while now and must retrace your footsteps until you find the point where you strayed off course. Unless, of course, you enjoy being lost in the woods!"}, {"text": "Any bad news that might come your way today or tomorrow will be eclipsed by the good news that comes toward the end of the week, so stay calm and don\u2019t let relatively minor stuff get you down. Life never stops changing and evolving."}, {"text": "There may be times today when you fear that you have bitten off more than you can chew, but even if that is the case nothing particularly bad will come from it, so stop worrying. Focus only on things that make you smile. Ignore the rest."}, {"text": "It may seem as if Lady Luck is smiling on you but in the greater scheme of things there is no such thing as \u201cluck\u201d, there are only events. Your task, as always, is to decide how to react to those events \u2013 and to enjoy them as well."}, {"text": "It will pay you to stay calm over the next 24 hours, even if everyone around you seems to be losing it. Someone needs to keep a cool head and if it can be you then your reputation will soar and the rewards will be considerable."}, {"text": "You will accomplish more today if you don\u2019t take life as seriously as you have done of late. The most productive thing you can do is to remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things your problems are really not that important."}, {"text": "If you seem to lack energy at the moment it may be because the universe is helping you to conserve it for later on, when you will need it more than you do now. Your special time is almost at hand Aquarius, so be patient."}, {"text": "Your overall attitude has been pleasingly positive of late and you must do all you can to keep it at that level. Others may say that you are ignoring the bad news but what you focus on is what you give power to, so you\u2019re right to look away."}, {"text": "You need to commit yourself 100 per cent to a project you have been tinkering with for the past six months or so. Yes, it can be fun thinking about \u201cwhat ifs\u201d but you need to move on from that now and get serious about your future in front of a wider range of people. If you have something to say, say it loud!"}, {"text": "If you need to impress someone in a position of authority, now is the time to do it. With so much cosmic activity in the career area of your chart almost anything you do will be looked on kindly by your employers. Show them how good you are."}, {"text": "The bigger the problem you are faced with the more you will like it today \u2013 if nothing else it gives you the opportunity to show off that big brain of yours. You could even spend a large part of the day solving other people\u2019s problems for them."}, {"text": "Keep what you have to say simple and to the point, because the more complicated it sounds the less likely it is to be understood. Not everyone has your way with words, especially big words, so limit them where you can to three syllables or less."}, {"text": "Life is too short to worry about things that in all probability will never happen, so get rid of all those negative thoughts that are swimming round in your head and act as if nothing can go wrong \u2013 and it won\u2019t. Doubts are for others, not for you."}, {"text": "How can you improve your work situation? According to the planets this is a good time to look closely at your everyday methods and routines and then make whatever changes are necessary. And remember, little changes can have big effects."}, {"text": "Be open and honest with everyone you meet today, even though your words won\u2019t always be greeted with gratitude. There is no reason why you should deceive either yourself or other people, so be frank in your opinions and get things done."}, {"text": "It will pay you to be nice to someone you don\u2019t much feel like being nice to today. This is one of those occasions when a kind word or two from you could have an almost instant, and highly positive, effect on your environment. "}, {"text": "This is a really good time for all kinds of communications and even if you receive \u201cbad\u201d news of some sort it will have a positive effect on what you are doing. Don\u2019t wait for others to contact you though \u2013 get out and about and get yourself heard."}, {"text": "You will learn something interesting, and potentially profitable, over the next 24 hours, but will you use it to your best advantage? The information is out there and if you don\u2019t make something of it you can be sure that your rivals will."}, {"text": "You will have some big decisions to make between now and when the Sun leaves your sign at the weekend, so get your head together and get busy working on all your dreams and schemes. The clock is ticking, so be quick."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t seem to want much to do with the world at the moment and that\u2019s okay \u2013 in fact it\u2019s natural. Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts and start making plans for the future \u2013 it will be here sooner than you think."}, {"text": "While everyone is under pressure and running all over the place you are a picture of calm. Do you know something the rest of the world does not? Yes, you do. You know from long experience that it\u2019s not worth getting worked up about anything!"}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to work yourself into the ground to get what you want. If you have a clear idea of what it is you desire, and hold that picture in your head at all times, success will come sooner and easier than you expected. It\u2019s all about vision."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to be overly cautious but you do have to recognize that you have more to lose than most people. Others can throw their money around and act as if the good times will never end, but you need to be a bit more realistic."}, {"text": "A riddle that has been bugging you for ages will be solved today, and most likely you will kick yourself mentally when you realize how obvious the answer was. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself \u2013 you weren\u2019t the only one to overlook the obvious."}, {"text": "Something will happen today that gives you the chance to prove how mentally tough you are. But once you have done so you should go back to being a nice guy. What matters is that you make your point \u2013 you don\u2019t have to live it."}, {"text": "One of the things you are good at Cancer is inspiring people to improve themselves and over the next few days you can and you must help those you are responsible for do more and do better. In a way you\u2019re their teacher \u2013 so teach well."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be foolish and try to make a major decision before you know all the facts. Your impatient nature could easily get the better of you and, in doing so, make it easier for your rivals to pick holes in what you are doing. Give yourself time."}, {"text": "Someone seems to have got the wrong end of the stick about something you said. Yes, of course, you were critical but it was for their own good. Maybe they don\u2019t see it that way Virgo. Maybe, just this once, you need to apologize."}, {"text": "After the sun moves in your favour at the weekend you will find it easier both to express yourself and to get things done on a creative level. Between now and then don\u2019t think too much or say too much or do too much. Stay calm and relax."}, {"text": "You have been in such great form of late that you may think the good times will never end. But they will, of course, and you need to get your head round that fact today. More serious times are coming \u2013 but you are still allowed to smile!"}, {"text": "Not many people will agree with the route you decide to take today but you know in your heart of hearts that it is the right one for you. Only you know what you really want out of life, so only you can decide what comes next."}, {"text": "No doubt you feel you could take on the world and win but as the sun moves towards the end of its stay in your sign you need to tone down your act a touch. You can still be a winner but you may have to work a bit harder at it."}, {"text": "The world will seem a much better place, for you at least, when the sun moves into your sign on the 20th. Between now and then you are strongly advised to get over any bad feelings you may have about certain people. Start with a clean slate."}, {"text": "If something takes you by surprise today chances are you will have only yourself to blame. The fact is you should have seen it coming when it was still a long way off, but now it is here you must deal with it. It won\u2019t be that difficult."}, {"text": "A Mercury-Pluto link on your birthday this year means you know your own mind and won\u2019t let anyone deceive or confuse you. Others can approach life on a superficial level if they want \u2013 you intend to dig deeper and find out what\u2019s really going on."}, {"text": "You can charm your way into anyone\u2019s affections today. With your ruler Mars on the best possible terms with love planet Venus you will be irresistible. Even your rivals and enemies will think you\u2019re something special \u2013 which, of course, you are."}, {"text": "The sun in your fellow earth sign of Capricorn endows you with no end of self-belief, but you also need a large dash of common sense. Today\u2019s Mercury-Pluto link will help you see through the fog and discover what is really going on in the world."}, {"text": "It does not matter what you are working on or how busy you may be, you must find an outlet for your physical and emotional desires. The planets demand that you spend some quality time with a special person today. Always make room for love."}, {"text": "Someone you have admired from afar for quite some time at last seems to have noticed you exist. So what\u2019s your next move? You must be bold Cancer. Don\u2019t play hard to get and hope they come after you. Make the first move and make it now."}, {"text": "It\u2019s one thing to be ambitious but quite another to make your dreams so outrageous that the chances of them coming true are minimal to say the least. Know what it is you want to possess and make sure your plan for getting it is sound."}, {"text": "As your ruling planet Mercury is linked with the way your mind works today\u2019s Mercury-Pluto link will have more meaning for you than most. Think deeply about what you are trying to do and then go for it with passion and purpose."}, {"text": "Something will happen today that forces you to face up to the fact that an idea or belief you have held for many years may not be as solid as you once imagined. Don\u2019t be afraid to let it go. There are better ideas waiting to replace it."}, {"text": "Why is everyone being so nice to you all of a sudden? Whatever the reason make the most of it because it won\u2019t last. Let those you live and work with know what you want and what they can do to help you get it \u2013 and they will."}, {"text": "A relationship that meant a lot to you in the past now seems unimportant and it won\u2019t hurt if you downgrade it a little and spend more time on other things. The only constant in life is change, so don\u2019t be afraid to move on."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let other people\u2019s criticisms get you down today because with mind planet Mercury firmly on your side there is nothing they can say or do that will deflect you from your goals. As far as you are concerned their opinions are worthless."}, {"text": "You need to recognize that there is good in everyone. It may at times seem as if a large chunk of humanity is either mad or bad but it isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s not humanity that needs to change, it\u2019s you who needs to adjust your outlook."}, {"text": "Have the strength to say \u201cno\u201d to something you know you won\u2019t enjoy. You cannot allow yourself to be persuaded to do what others want you to do simply because you don\u2019t want to rock the boat. Rock it hard and, if others fall out, that\u2019s too bad."}, {"text": "The word \u201cchanges\u201d is writ large on the horizon and the simple fact is you won\u2019t be able to escape the upheavals that are headed your way. But why would you want to? Life is supposed to be exciting, so treat it all as one big adventure \u2013 and aim to win."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Uranus link warns you must tread carefully, in particular on the work front where you really don\u2019t want to upset people in positions of power. Everyone is feeling a bit touchy at the moment, so watch what you say and do."}, {"text": "The only danger this weekend is that you may be in too much of a rush and make the kind of elementary mistake that leaves you looking silly. Deal with what you are working on a step at a time and make sure you get it right."}, {"text": "Do something dramatic this weekend, something that reminds the world who you are and why you should be taken seriously. Make sure it\u2019s legal, of course, but don\u2019t worry if the line between good taste and bad gets blurred a little."}, {"text": "You may not be in the mood to compromise at the moment but the planets indicate you have no choice in the matter. Today\u2019s sun-Uranus link will confront you with an issue that demands a joint approach. You cannot possibly handle it alone."}, {"text": "If a friend or relative starts to say something you know is going to be embarrassing then cut them off quickly and steer the talk in a different direction. They will thank you for it later when they realize you did them a favor."}, {"text": "The stars are very much on your side at the moment but there is a danger that you will come out with something that results in a black mark being put against your name. Watch what you say, both in your personal affairs and at work."}, {"text": "You may want to give someone who has incurred your displeasure a serious talking to but a voice in the back of your head says that might be the wrong thing to do. Stay calm and don\u2019t let your emotions take over \u2013 they could take you too far!"}, {"text": "You need to face up to aspects of your personality that you might prefer to keep hidden. The fact is everyone has negative attributes of one sort or other, so get over yourself and get busy on showing your more positive side to the world."}, {"text": "If your sixth sense tells you that something is not a good idea then you should listen to it and do something different this weekend.

Listen to what they tell you and maybe act on it too. They might just save you from yourself."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Uranus link means this is not a good time to take risks. Why? Because once you have gambled on one thing you will immediately be tempted to gamble on another, and then another \u2013 and even if you win to begin with you will lose in the end."}, {"text": "Your ability to sense what is about to happen before it actually occurs will come in useful over the next few months. Some people may see this talent as slightly spooky, but the reality is you can see farther and wider than they are capable of."}, {"text": "As the sun changes signs today it is more than possible that the way you look at the world will change as well.

Can you see yourself doing the same thing 10 years from now?"}, {"text": "The more other people try to convince you that their way of looking at life is the right way the more suspicious you will be, and rightly so. You really don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help in coming to the correct conclusions as to what is going on in the world."}, {"text": "A windfall of some kind could come your way over the next few days and if it does it will be fully deserved.

That\u2019s an improvement, of course, but you still need to be on your guard."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let little things worry you over the next few days.

That applies to all areas of your life but in particular to your home situation where certain people could be even more touchy and emotional than they usually are. Keep your head at all times."}, {"text": "Your powers of persuasion will be high today but don\u2019t waste them on people who cannot help you move closer to your long-term goals. Also, avoid the kind of gossip and cheap talk that some people enjoy but which cannot do you any good personally."}, {"text": "If you let certain people know that you are desperate to be taken seriously they will go out of their way to make fun of you, so keep your thoughts to yourself and act as if you are supremely self-confident.

The fact is you need to say goodbye to people who are holding you back. Be ruthless and then move on."}, {"text": "Sometimes all you have to do is snap your fingers and others come running, but that won\u2019t happen today. On the contrary, if you behave in an imperious way you will be ignored \u2013 and nothing deflates an Aries ego quicker than being an outsider."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s lunar eclipse means you will need to take extra care when dealing with people in one-to-one situations, both at home and at work. Minor differences could easily flare up into major disagreements, so be careful what you say."}, {"text": "Someone will make you an interesting offer today but your sixth sense tells you there could be a catch \u2013 and there is.

You\u2019ll be glad you did."}, {"text": "This is not a good time for business and financial affairs, so neither a lender nor a borrower be, and don\u2019t take risks with your hard-earned cash. What you most need to remember is that there is no such thing as a certainty \u2013 only losers believe that."}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s lunar eclipse falls in your sign there is a good chance that you will be more emotional than usual.

Stay calm at all costs."}, {"text": "Your workload will increase quite a bit today and to say the least you won\u2019t be happy about it.

If you can get yourself into a relaxed state of mind then life will be a breeze."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to hide the way you feel about someone because your emotions are evident in your facial expressions and your body language. The good news is that your feelings for them are extremely positive \u2013 and loving too."}, {"text": "No matter how badly you have fallen out with a friend or family member you can and you must patch things up with them today. Forget about what was said and done in the past and move forward together to a much brighter future."}, {"text": "You seem to be at one with the world at the moment \u2013 and the world is pretty fond of you too.

The universe confirms that you are on the right track \u2013 so keep going!"}, {"text": "The more of an effort you make to be nice to people you work with today the more they will do for you in return. Someone you have always considered to be a rival, maybe even an enemy, will surprise you with their friendly attitude."}, {"text": "Your way with words will help you considerably over the coming year but you must be honest at all times and in all situations. Just because you can persuade others that black is white does not make it a fact. Most importantly, be honest with yourself."}, {"text": "If you keep your eyes and ears open today you might see or hear something to your advantage. You will have to work fast though as you won\u2019t be the only one who sees the potential in what\u2019s going on. Be the first to react."}, {"text": "It does not matter how many tough issues you have to deal with, either at home or at work, nothing will shake your belief that the world is a wonderful place and that you have a special place in it. With that kind of conviction, you will go far."}, {"text": "If someone has been deceiving you in some way you will catch them out today.

There\u2019s still time to change your ways."}, {"text": "You will have no choice but to do what others want you to do today. The one choice you do have is how you react to their demands. Approach life with a smile rather than a frown over the next 24 hours \u2013 it will make all the difference."}, {"text": "Be friends with everyone you meet today and don\u2019t let the occasional negative comment get you down. Just because someone you have dealings with is feeling a bit glum at the moment does not mean you have to feel the same."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that you will have to make a few sacrifices today but if you make them willingly and do what you have to do to the best of your ability you will also make considerable gains \u2013 not least in the way others choose to treat you."}, {"text": "If you make a wish today it might just come true \u2013 but the downside is it will also come with a lot of extras that you have to accept as well.

Don\u2019t ignore what you find."}, {"text": "Are you happy with your life? Most likely you are, but even if you are generally content with your existence there are things you can do to make it even better. You know what they are and you know all you have to do is start. Start now."}, {"text": "You need to be more positive about your involvement in some kind of group activity. Up until now you have been lingering on the sidelines but the time has come to get more directly involved. If you\u2019re involved then you must go all the way."}, {"text": "Upheavals on the work front won\u2019t worry you so much if you make an effort to understand them. Employers and other powerful people are not acting out of spite, they are doing what they honestly believe to be best for everyone.

Mercury, your ruler and planet of the mind, moves in your favor today, so get your head together, then act."}, {"text": "You may clash today with someone whose way of looking at the world is very much at odds with your own, but that\u2019s okay. You will learn more from arguing with them than you will from agreeing with like-minded friends and colleagues."}, {"text": "You are who you are and there is no point trying to be someone else. That is the message of the stars for you today Leo and if you accept it you will enjoy yourself immensely. Life is not intended to be chore so have fun while you can."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you will go too far or say too much today and regret it later on, but that\u2019s just the way it is. The simple fact is you cannot please everyone you meet, so you might as well please yourself first and foremost."}, {"text": "As mind planet Mercury moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today you need to think seriously about what you want to achieve over the coming year or so. Be creative and don\u2019t let doubt or fear hold you back. You CAN get it done."}, {"text": "You should find it easier to get through to loved ones now that Mercury, planet of communication, is moving into the domestic area of your chart. Tell them, in plain and simple language, what it is you expect of them. Chances are you\u2019ll get it."}, {"text": "You will find your voice today \u2013 and it will most likely be a loud one! You have lots to say for yourself and you are well past the stage where you care what other people think about your opinions \u2013 they\u2019ll hear them even if they don\u2019t want to."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t break free of some sort of restriction now then you might as well give up on the idea. Whatever obstacle has been in your way you need to smash past it and let the world see you won\u2019t allow yourself to be limited. Do it now."}, {"text": "You will feel much more alive and alert now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving into your sign. You will also have a much clearer idea of what it is you are aiming for and what you need to do to reach your goal."}, {"text": "Try not to get obsessive about an issue that is of no real importance. Pisces is an emotional sign and you can at times let your feelings sweep you along, but now you need to use your brain. Listen to your head rather than your heart."}, {"text": "Mars and Jupiter combine on your birthday in a way that fuels your energy and sparks your enthusiasm. Throw yourself into whatever it is that gives you most pleasure and don\u2019t feel in the least bit guilty about it. Life is for loving and laughing."}, {"text": "If you come to the conclusion that something you\u2019ve been working on is no longer worth the effort then give up on it and move on to something else. All change is ultimately good change, so don\u2019t be afraid to take a new path."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to do a complicated job on your own, even if you honestly believe that you are more likely to make a success of it than anyone else. If you don\u2019t learn to delegate responsibility you could soon exhaust yourself."}, {"text": "Life is good and getting better by the day, the hour, even the minute. You may not believe that yet but you will start to believe it over the next few days. Friendships are under excellent stars at the moment, so seek out people who make you happy."}, {"text": "Someone you look up to on the work front will do something that inspires you to do something similar yourself. Before you do though you need to recognize that you are very different personalities. Are you sure this is the right way for you?"}, {"text": "No matter how popular a Leo you may be right now you will be even more popular over the weekend and into next week. With Mars and Jupiter highlighting the most dynamic areas of your chart you can\u2019t help but do something amazing."}, {"text": "Because some of the changes now taking place in your life are of an intimate nature you may try to deny to yourself that they are happening. Come on Virgo, you are supposed to be the zodiac\u2019s most honest sign \u2013 so be honest with yourself."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s Mars-Jupiter link will get things moving again on the relationship front and before you know it you will be making friends with some very interesting people.

You still have human limits."}, {"text": "Jupiter, your ruler, links with action planet Mars today, making you even more outgoing and optimistic than you usually are. Whatever you do today and over the weekend, do it with purpose and passion. Others will enjoy watching you in action."}, {"text": "Avoid making any kind of moral judgments about other people\u2019s behaviour. If what they are doing is not to your liking then simply get up and go some place else. There\u2019s no cosmic law that says you have to keep them company."}, {"text": "No matter how hard you try to explain yourself to someone today it\u2019s unlikely you will find the right mix of words to convey your true meaning. In which case you might as well stop trying and let your actions speak for you. They\u2019ll get the message."}, {"text": "Work issues are under good stars at the moment, so if you are in any way ambitious then now is the time to let the powers that be know what it is that you want. Chances are it\u2019s what they want too, so you\u2019ll make a good team."}, {"text": "There is almost nothing you cannot do over the coming 12 months but you need to have a clear target to aim for and you need to commit to it 100 per cent. Ignore everything else that\u2019s going on in the world \u2013 it\u2019s your world that matters."}, {"text": "Let the world around you know what you can do \u2013 and what it can do for you. Because you are so independent by nature you can at times seem a bit aloof, but you\u2019re not really. This is a great time for friendships, so open up more."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t much like sudden changes but that\u2019s too bad because a lot of things in your life are in a state of flux at the moment and, like it not, you\u2019re going along for the ride. Instead of fighting change, why not accept it and work with it?"}, {"text": "Nothing and no one can be allowed to hold you back. The sun in Aquarius at this time of year invites you to spread your wings and fly, both in the physical sense and on a mental level. The world is so much bigger than you think it is."}, {"text": "You may not be entirely convinced that what is happening in your life is for the best but it is, so give it time to work itself out and give yourself time to get your head around what\u2019s going on. This weekend \u2013 just relax and have fun."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to bottle up your emotions because those who know you best can see your feelings written in your face. Be open and honest about what has been upsetting you, then look for solutions with the people you love."}, {"text": "Both at home and at work this could be a physically tiring weekend. The planets suggest you will be called upon to shoulder the kind of burdens that normal people find too heavy. But, of course, you\u2019re not normal people, you\u2019re a Virgo!"}, {"text": "Don't let fear hold you back this weekend. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart promises that you CAN do something out of the ordinary and that it WILL be a huge success. Have faith in yourself."}, {"text": "Life seems to get faster by the day and the next 24 hours won\u2019t be any different. The good news is you will easily be able to keep up with whatever changes are taking place. The not so good news is you may have to rescue someone who can\u2019t."}, {"text": "The sooner you assert your authority the quicker you will be able to get past some kind of logjam in your everyday affairs. It\u2019s not really a big issue but some people are trying to make it look like one. You\u2019re not the sort to be fooled."}, {"text": "You should find it easier to make money now that both the sun and Mercury are moving through the financial area of your chart but don\u2019t make getting rich for the sake of it your main aim. Channel what you earn into positive areas."}, {"text": "You can expect some amazing things to occur over the next 48 hours and whatever they happen to be you will be at the centre of them. Don\u2019t be too passive though. This is your time of year and you have the power to set the agenda."}, {"text": "It\u2019s natural that you should feel a bit unsure of yourself now the sun is moving through the most sensitive area of your chart but don\u2019t let it affect what you are doing for other people. In fact, working for others will help you feel better about yourself."}, {"text": "If you make an effort to put other people first over the coming 12 months then the universe will reward you in numerous ways. It is one of the basic facts of life that what you do for, or to, someone else, always comes back to you in the end."}, {"text": "A lot of good causes would benefit from your input and your leadership qualities, so why are you still not getting involved? Put your confidence and courage to good use this week by helping people who have not been anywhere near as fortunate as you."}, {"text": "Do whatever it takes to help a friend or family member who is finding life tough. Try not to be judgmental about what they have done, and what it has cost them \u2013 just offer your services with no questions asked. You could be their saviour."}, {"text": "You have never been slow to adapt to changing circumstances and what occurs over the next few days will demonstrate just how quickly you can get your act together when the situation demands it. Mentally, at least, you are on a higher level than most other people."}, {"text": "No matter how hard you try to shield a friend from an unpleasant truth they will eventually have to face up to the fact that they got something badly wrong. Make sure they are aware how they reached this position, then help them get out of it."}, {"text": "Sometimes you just have to let the mask slip a bit and let others in on how you are feeling, especially if you are feeling less than great. You don\u2019t have to be the tough guy all the time Leo \u2013 you are allowed to show your vulnerable side."}, {"text": "What happens today will have a major impact on your relationship situation. The most important thing by far is that you are ready to forgive and forget when partners and loved ones and friends let you down. They will appreciate your understanding."}, {"text": "Can you turn dreams into realities? Of course you can. It does not matter in the slightest what others say can or cannot be done \u2013 as a Libra you can do anything you please, so long as you believe in yourself. Start making your dreams come true today."}, {"text": "Wishful thinking is not always a bad thing and with helpful cosmic activity in one of the more creative areas of your chart today you should be making wishes left, right and center. What you desire may be outrageous to some but for you it\u2019s business as usual."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t always feel comfortable with open displays of emotion but a loved one\u2019s tears will move you today. The best way to help them, of course, is to be practical and insist that they be practical too \u2013 but it\u2019s okay to show some sympathy as well."}, {"text": "Others may say your ideas are too eccentric to work but you know from long experience that if you apply yourself and refuse to give up then anything is possible. Ignore those who say your plans are sure to fail and do what feels right to you."}, {"text": "You could hit the jackpot today if you listen to, and act on, what your inner voice is trying to tell you. It may be that the rest of the world says you have got it completely wrong but the rest of the world can, for now, be safely ignored."}, {"text": "Your ability to tune in to other people\u2019s feelings will come in useful today, and may even change your life in some way. If you find it within your power to assist one of your fellow human beings then do so with no questions asked. Love everyone equally."}, {"text": "If you are serious about not just changing but transforming your life then now is the time to start doing those things that can make it happen. Forget about what other people expect of you \u2013 only ever do what you expect of yourself."}, {"text": "All things are possible if you dare to take a risk today. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big risk either \u2013 it could well be the case that the most minor effort on your part could lead to major benefits, both for yourself and for those you love."}, {"text": "You may be hugely ambitious but the planets warn you could be too ambitious for your own good over the next few days. There are so many things you can do now but there is one thing you must not do \u2013 and that\u2019s exhaust yourself by doing too much."}, {"text": "While everyone else seems to be cracking under pressure you are growing stronger by the minute. What\u2019s your secret? Whatever it is you are advised to keep faith with it today and throughout the week. You are destined for marvellous things!"}, {"text": "According to the planets you could make some serious money over the next few days, but to do so you may have to give up something in return. Decide if it is a trade worth making and then, if it is, go with it all the way."}, {"text": "Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Leo! The world is a wonderful place and your own position in it is nothing to feel bad about. Make a point of counting your blessings over the next 24 hours \u2013 and then enjoy them one by one."}, {"text": "This may be a tough time of year for you but there are ways you can make life easier for yourself, not least by being positive at all times. Negative thoughts will feed on each other and drag you down \u2013 and you must not let that happen."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste time and energy trying to convert people to your point of view \u2013 most likely that will just send them hurrying off in the opposite direction! Unless, of course, you are playing a double bluff game and want them to go that way."}, {"text": "The planets warn that you need to keep your enthusiasm under control, because if you get carried away you could bite off more than you can chew and choke yourself! You don\u2019t have to be the biggest and the best at everything you do Scorpio."}, {"text": "Even your best-laid plans are likely to hit some kind of snag today, but don\u2019t let it worry you. In the greater scheme of things you are still heading in the right direction, so replace that frown with a smile and just keep going."}, {"text": "There is something you want to do that is clearly right for you, but you are holding back because you are scared it might go wrong and leave you looking foolish. You\u2019re right, it might. But how good will you look if you never try? Get on with it."}, {"text": "You need to be looking both forward and back at the moment, because the lessons you learn from your past will make it many times more likely that your future will be bright. Also, don\u2019t ever fear failure \u2013 it\u2019s invariably a stepping stone to success."}, {"text": "Yes, you might wish that you were in someone else\u2019s shoes at the moment, but look at it another way: there are at least five billion people who would love to be in your shoes. You are where you are, and you are who you are \u2013 so enjoy it."}, {"text": "Some people measure their wealth by what they own and earn but your wealth will be measured by the quality of your friendships over the coming year. You\u2019re not alone now and you never will be alone \u2013 there are no end of people out there who adore you."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t get on with everyone you meet today and it\u2019s quite possible you won\u2019t get on with anyone at all, but will that bother you? Of course not! You\u2019re an Aries, you don\u2019t require anyone\u2019s approval or acceptance but your own."}, {"text": "What you need to bear in mind today is that while you may be good at something there is sure to be someone who is better than you. It\u2019s no big deal and in no way suggests that you are inferior. Be realistic about what you can do."}, {"text": "You seem to have got the wrong end of the stick where an affair of the heart is concerned and now you need to make amends. There is no point being embarrassed that you made a mistake \u2013 you\u2019re human like the rest of us."}, {"text": "You know what you can do but do colleagues and employers and other important people know? If not you must make it your business today to showcase your talents so they cannot overlook you. Sell yourself Cancer, because no one else will."}, {"text": "Make sure others tell you the truth, even if you suspect that what you are about to be told won\u2019t be to your liking. It\u2019s always better to know what is really going on than to pretend that everything is rosy when deep down you know it isn\u2019t."}, {"text": "Make a point of counting your blessings today. When you have finished \u2013 and it may take longer than you imagined \u2013 your mood will be considerably improved. In the greater scheme of things you are one of life\u2019s lucky ones, so cheer up."}, {"text": "The more people you have to deal with today the more it may feel as if events are slipping out of your control. Find ways to cut yourself off from too much human contact, at least for a while. Too much sensory input can be overwhelming."}, {"text": "If you rush into something you don\u2019t know much about today you run the risk of making a silly mistake and then having to admit that others know better than you. Know who you are and what you can do Scorpio. You don\u2019t have to pretend."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to find it hard to be direct with people but for some reason you are reluctant to say what you mean. If you are worried about hurting someone\u2019s feelings be assured they won\u2019t mind at all \u2013 they prefer it when you are blunt."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to start something new merely for the sake of it or because other people are busy doing things. Slow down and take it easy for a while \u2013 you don\u2019t need to challenge your mind and your body every day of the week."}, {"text": "You can make yourself happy or you can make yourself sad \u2013 the effort it takes is exactly the same. In which case it seems ridiculous that you keep looking on the dark side of things. Lighten up Aquarius, it\u2019s life, and life should always be fun."}, {"text": "Your emotions could be a bit unsteady today, so promise yourself now that whatever happens you won\u2019t overreact. You probably will, of course, but if you are aware that you are in a volatile mood then hopefully you won\u2019t go too far."}, {"text": "There is no doubt in your mind about what you have to do next \u2013 you know with every fibre of your being that you are on the right path and just need to keep marching. Whatever you consider \u201csuccess\u201d to be, it will be yours this year."}, {"text": "You may not entirely approve of what a friend or loved one is doing but you are not about to condemn them for being adventurous, not when you delight in taking chances yourself. If they fall, help them up. If they fly, applaud them."}, {"text": "It\u2019s important that you know what it is you are after, because if you don\u2019t know your own mind how can you expect others to work out what you are thinking? Decide what it is you most want to do then do it to the best of your ability."}, {"text": "If you feel out of place in your present location then get up and go somewhere else. Don\u2019t worry that others might think you are being rude, or even that you no longer like or love them \u2013 the only thing that matters is your own peace of mind."}, {"text": "Try not to read anything untoward into what a friend or relative tells you today. Yes, maybe they could have been more careful in their choice of words but they mean well and that\u2019s what matters. You can be a bit too touchy at times."}, {"text": "With the sun, your ruler, joining forces with Mercury in the partnership area of your chart today you will know precisely what words to use to get people on your side. Everyone wants to be your friend, and you should aim to be friends with everyone."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to take some kind of risk on the work front but only do so if the odds of success are strongly in your favor. Even then the planets warn you could make a serious miscalculation. You don\u2019t HAVE to take that risk Virgo."}, {"text": "You are in tune with the spirit of the times and know that whatever you do or however you choose to do it somehow or other it will work out just fine. With that kind of self-belief you really can create something wonderful. Start doing it now."}, {"text": "Good things will happen if you want them to happen and bad things will happen if you allow yourself to think that the world is against you. The fact is your mind creates your reality, so be open and positive and strive to love everyone. "}, {"text": "Listen carefully to what others have to tell you today because even if you think you know all you need to know about a certain situation they can teach you something new. It could save you wasting time on things that cannot possibly work."}, {"text": "You may find it difficult to make up your mind over something today but chances are there is a very good cosmic reason for that. The sun in the money area of your chart warns you need to take more care with your financial resources."}, {"text": "There are so many possibilities available to you now that you may find it difficult deciding which path is best. Even so, you need to choose quickly because these positive influences won\u2019t last for long. Select a goal and go for it."}, {"text": "You may need to be a bit selfish today. Why? Because you have such a sweet and trusting and generous nature that you risk doing everything for other people and nothing at all for yourself. You\u2019re allowed to have fun as well Pisces."}, {"text": "You may not think of yourself as a \u201cfeeling\u201d sort of person but your birthday chart suggests that emotions of one kind or another will dominate both your personal and professional affairs over the coming year. Listen to your head but follow your heart."}, {"text": "If other people try to tell you what to do and how to do it you must resist. Make it clear to them that you alone decide what your priorities are going to be and you alone decide how to go about reaching your goals. They\u2019ll get the message."}, {"text": "Think long and hard before ending a partnership that won\u2019t be easy to start up again. You may feel as if you have gone as far as you can together but the planets indicate you have some unfinished business that could be profitable for you both."}, {"text": "Partners and loved ones will be exceptionally demanding over the next 24 hours and there may be times when you come close to telling them in no uncertain terms what you think of their attitude. Don\u2019t. It will only make matters worse."}, {"text": "The next few days could be busier than you anticipated, especially on the work front, so pace yourself and make sure you have enough energy left in your tank to deal with the kind of sudden changes that inevitably take a lot out of you."}, {"text": "According to the planets someone is being less than honest with you about what they intend to do. Does it matter? Yes it does, because their actions will inevitably have an impact on your own. Get them to open up about their goals \u2013 you have a right to know."}, {"text": "You have no doubt heard the saying that the only thing to fear is fear itself, and of course you agree, but it\u2019s not easy keeping negative feelings under control. Today though you must. Be relentlessly positive in everything you say and do."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s lunar eclipse of Saturn takes place in one of the more emotional areas of your chart, so your calm exterior is sure to crack at some point. The results may be messy but they won\u2019t be fatal, so let it happen and then move on quickly."}, {"text": "You are attaching too much importance to what other people think and say. Yes, of course you should listen to what friends and colleagues have to tell you but ultimately what you choose to believe is entirely up to you. Trust your own mind."}, {"text": "If you think that a friend or relative is wasting your time with petty complaints then let them know that you won\u2019t put up with it. Don\u2019t worry that you might sound a bit harsh \u2013 it\u2019s probably the only way you will get through to them."}, {"text": "Put petty matters and petty people out of your mind and focus only on the things that truly matter. There is no reason at all why you should waste time and energy on issues that mean nothing to you personally. It\u2019s your life, so live it your way."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to get along with someone today and there may even be some sharp words between you, but it\u2019s no big deal. By this time tomorrow everything will be back to normal and you will be friends again. It\u2019s just a passing emotional storm."}, {"text": "If there is something you need to get done today then you must do it yourself. If you get other people involved the result could be the kind of muddle that makes things worse. It may be more work for you but at least it will be good work."}, {"text": "This is going to the kind of year when the decisions you make affect not only you personally but everyone around you both at home and at work. Don\u2019t just think of the consequences of your actions but of the consequences of your thoughts as well."}, {"text": "If you are going to get the most out of life you will have to start taking a few more risks and with Mars in your sign that won\u2019t be too hard. Don\u2019t think too deeply about the consequences of what you do, just act and see what happens."}, {"text": "If you are hoping to get approval for your plans you are going to be disappointed. But why do you need other people\u2019s support in the first place? If your conscience tells you that what you are doing is right that\u2019s all the approval you need."}, {"text": "Although some people you have to deal with today may be irrational in their behaviour that does not mean you can react to them in the same way. Your greatest strength is your mind, so use it to stay calm and work out rationally what you need to do."}, {"text": "Are other people making life difficult for you, or are you making life difficult for yourself? The planets suggest it\u2019s the latter, so stop feeling sorry for yourself, get your act together and get started on what you most need to do. Work is good for you."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in your opposite sign is making it hard for you to make a move to do with a partnership matter, but maybe there\u2019s a good reason for that, maybe it\u2019s not the right time to act. Monday\u2019s new moon will get things moving again."}, {"text": "You may be worried that a friend is about to make a serious mistake but they are in no mood to listen to your advice, so save your breath \u2013 and save your energy for when you have to reach down and help them get back on their feet again."}, {"text": "Is what you are doing what you choose to be doing, or is it what other people want you to do? Most likely it\u2019s the latter, so seize back control of your life and do only what your inner voice says is right for you personally."}, {"text": "The most important thing today is that you don\u2019t waste time comparing yourself to other people, especially those above you on the ladder of success. Jealousy is never an attractive trait and today it might even be dangerous for you."}, {"text": "What seems like a difficult decision to make early in the day will become easier as time goes on, so don\u2019t worry that you might not be able to get your act together, because you will. The fact is you are more decisive than most people."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you have not yet reached the goals and objectives you set for yourself a while back \u2013 you are still on course to succeed. Remember, schedules and strategies are only guideposts \u2013 you also need to be flexible."}, {"text": "Changing the past is impossible but changing the future is easy \u2013 you just have to do things differently right now. The sun in your sign will point you in the right direction today and over the weekend \u2013 and that direction is straight to the top."}, {"text": "Someone you are close to is in need of a dose of reality and you are the one who will give it to them. Which is ironic considering that usually it\u2019s you who gets lost in a dream world. Today though you\u2019ll be logical in the extreme."}, {"text": "A Mars-Pluto link on your birthday means the combative side of your nature will be close to the surface over the coming 12 months. Keep it under control and use it only in situations where there is a serious goal to reach or a serious threat to counter."}, {"text": "With Mars, your ruler and planet of energy, barging its way through your sign this weekend you will find it easy enough to defend your interests. But don\u2019t go too far and say or do things you might later regret. People are not the enemy."}, {"text": "The planets are trying to tell you that you are reading too much into a situation that is actually quite normal \u2013 or what passes for normal these days. Switch off the intellectual side of your mind and listen to your inner voice. It knows the answers."}, {"text": "A friend will get angry with you today and there may on the surface seem to be no obvious reason for it. Most likely though they are harboring a grudge you have forgotten about. Resolve it together and then move on as friends again."}, {"text": "Someone is counting on you to ride to their rescue today and you, will, of course, help them out if they are in serious trouble. But if, as seems likely, it is really a quite minor affair you must tell them to stop wasting your time."}, {"text": "You could spend a great deal of time and energy trying to explain your position to people you live with and work for \u2013 or you could just get on and do what you were going to do anyway. Do you really care what they think? Of course not."}, {"text": "You may have to hold a loved one\u2019s hand and guide them in the direction they need to go but it will be worth the effort. Sometimes it takes someone like you with a logical turn of mind to help others see what is right before their eyes."}, {"text": "It might be wise to keep your thoughts to yourself this weekend as a rather dangerous looking Mars-Pluto link suggests that personality clashes are more likely than not. No matter how childishly a certain someone is behaving you are advised to ignore it."}, {"text": "Just because you can do twice as much work as your nearest competitor does not mean you have to do that much. In fact, because you are so much more efficient than they are you should be aiming to do less while getting more benefit from it."}, {"text": "You may not know how or why you have reached a certain conclusion but the voice in the back of your mind has no doubt that you are correct, so listen to it and act on what it tells you \u2013 this very moment, not some time \u201clater on\u201d."}, {"text": "It may be the case that someone has let you down but the planets warn this is not a good time to make a big scene about it. If you confront them now the situation could rapidly escalate and you might never be friends again."}, {"text": "You may have a dozen and one things on the go this weekend but if you try to do it all at once there is a very real possibility that you will injure yourself in some way. And be nice to people, or someone else might injure you too!"}, {"text": "Try not to get uptight with people who annoy you in small ways. Yes, of course, they can sometimes be difficult to live with but the last thing you want or need now is to risk elevating minor differences into major showdowns. It\u2019s not worth it."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be shy about making your opinions known over the coming year, but you also need to be smart and recognize that certain people have the power to make your life difficult if they don\u2019t like your attitude. Don\u2019t be argumentative for the sake of it."}, {"text": "What you are told today by someone who seems to know what they are talking about may sound convincing but a worm of unease in your mind warns you need to be careful. Later on you may discover they were in fact trying to deceive you."}, {"text": "Other people will be quick to give you advice today but you must not be quick to take it. Yes, some of your ideas may be excellent, but others could lead you down a path you really don\u2019t want to go. No decisions are required of you yet."}, {"text": "You have what it takes to make a huge success of a project that up until now you have been a bit half-hearted about. The thing is, Gemini, you need to recognize what you are good at, then you need to give that one thing your all."}, {"text": "You may be having doubts about something you got involved with a while back but there is no way you can stop it now, so hold on tight and enjoy the ride! Just because it gets bumpy in places does not mean it cannot be fun."}, {"text": "You always look and act confident but deep down you have doubts about what you are doing. Those doubts can and must be faced up to over the next few days, or else they will continue to nag at you. It\u2019s all or nothing Leo, as always."}, {"text": "As your ruling planet Mercury moves into your opposite sign today you will suddenly understand why a friend or loved one has been acting in ways that don\u2019t make sense. From their point of view they are being perfectly rational."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t mind working hard but the planets indicate that the time has come to lay off some of your workload so you can have more time to enjoy yourself. You may not be able to avoid your commitments but you can get others to help you."}, {"text": "Your attitude towards creative activities and affairs of the heart seems much more positive now and that is sure to bring good things, and good people, your way over the next few days. Banish negativity from your mind once and for all."}, {"text": "You have a way with words and you must use it to persuade a loved one that you are still very much on their side. Because you have been so preoccupied with other tasks lately they may believe you no longer care \u2013 but you have never cared more."}, {"text": "Some people say that talk is cheap but you know that the right words, used in the right place and at the right time, can do wonders. You will know just what to say and just when to say it today \u2013 and for everyone\u2019s benefit, not just your own."}, {"text": "The only danger as the new week begins is that you will allow yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security. There are people out there who will happily cheat you if they think they can get away with it \u2013 so be on your guard at all times."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, moves into your sign today and straight away you will find that your thoughts are clearer and your words flow without hesitation. That\u2019s good, because a more positive outlook is a must if you are to realize your dreams."}, {"text": "This could hardly be a better birthday for you as a powerful new moon promises that the coming year will be full of wonderful opportunities. Forget the past, it\u2019s gone and best forgotten. The future is what matters, and your future is bright."}, {"text": "You must not let anything hold you back or limit your horizons. The more you desire the more likely it is your desires will turn into realities, so ignore what others say is impossible and make it possible. For you Aries, there are no limits."}, {"text": "Anyone who doubts you have the courage and the commitment to succeed won\u2019t doubt it much longer. Today\u2019s new moon in the career area of your chart means you are determined to make your mark \u2013 and it\u2019s sure to be a huge one!"}, {"text": "This is one of the best times of the year for you and it will get even better if you are prepared to put yourself out and put your own interests ahead of the interests of other people. That may sound selfish but it is perfectly legitimate."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in one of the more secretive areas of your chart suggests you won\u2019t be very sociable today, but that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t waste time trying to explain why you need to spend time alone, just do it and let others draw their own conclusions."}, {"text": "Because you like to call the shots in most if not all your relationships this could be a difficult day, not least because partners and loved ones have no intention of listening to your advice or doing things your way. There\u2019s no cosmic reason why they should."}, {"text": "As usual you have been working your fingers to the bone and as usual you have got very little thanks for it. Does it not occur to you that you should be doing less for other people and more for yourself? Make that your aim today."}, {"text": "Creative endeavours will go very well indeed for you today, so don\u2019t stick with what you know, make a point of doing something different, something that marks you out as a special talent. It\u2019s time to blaze your own trail rather than following other people."}, {"text": "The week ahead of you can be very good or it can be very bad \u2013 it all depends on the attitude you choose to adopt. Be positive about everything Scorpio, even things that seem utterly negative. There is a reason for everything in this life."}, {"text": "The more you are on the move today the happier you will be. Where you go and what you do is of less importance than the fact that you are getting out and about and meeting new people \u2013 people who will bring new ideas and opportunities."}, {"text": "Money matters are under fortunate stars at the moment, so if you need to improve your cash-flow situation now is the time to make the kind of changes that will make life easier in the short-term and maybe make you rich in the long-term."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the best days of the year for you as the new moon in your sign means that your body, mind and emotions are all working together at the same high level. Decide what it is you want most from life, then make it happen."}, {"text": "Resolve right now that you will ignore anything negative that others might say to you or about you. Yes, of course, criticism can be constructive, but on this occasion it is the opposite of what you truly need. Be relentlessly positive in word and deed."}, {"text": "The simple life is not for you and over the coming year you will go out of your way to follow a path that leads in all sorts of weird and wonderful directions. Why? Because life is more fun when you never know what each new day will bring!"}, {"text": "Try not to do anything too silly today. Try not to do anything that even by your standards is way over the top. To you it may be just a piece of harmless fun but other people may not be so relaxed about it. There are limits Aries."}, {"text": "If you are having doubts about a financial matter it may well be that your subconscious mind is trying to inform you of something you need to know. Shut out all the noisy chatter and listen to your inner voice. Then do what it tells you."}, {"text": "Something you thought was quite straightforward will take a turn for the worse and to begin with you will be at a loss to know why. There are though a number of clues which can help you. You missed them the first time but don\u2019t miss them today."}, {"text": "Why do you believe what you believe? That question will be much on your mind today. You need to find out if your thoughts are your own thoughts or if, as you suspect, they are thoughts that have been planted in your head by other people."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval to follow a course of action you know is right for you, so get on and do it and, if others complain, do it even more. Since when have you been the sort to care what the world thinks of you?"}, {"text": "Because you are so well organized it can annoy you when other people\u2019s disjointed way of doing things makes life difficult for you. Let them know about it. Loudly. There is absolutely no reason why you should have to put up with second rate work."}, {"text": "Stay calm and stay focused on your No. 1 aim. With the sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart most things will go well for you now but there will inevitably be a setback or two. It\u2019s really no big deal."}, {"text": "If someone offers you some kind of deal today you would be wise to think about it long and hard before accepting. According to the planets there could be strings attached \u2013 the kind that tie you in knots rather than hold you up!"}, {"text": "The reason a loved one is acting a little bit cold toward you at the moment is because you said or did something that upset them. If you have no idea what it is then you must ask them. They are, after all, more sensitive than you."}, {"text": "You have been pushing yourself extremely hard in recent weeks and need to go easier on yourself. The planets indicate if you don\u2019t slow down then an unexpected event could force you to slow down. Yes, it could be painful, so heed the warning."}, {"text": "You can be rather assertive when the mood takes you and with the effects of yesterday\u2019s powerful new moon still being felt you won\u2019t take any kind of nonsense, not even from people you love. Be assertive, but steer clear of outright aggression."}, {"text": "The planets warn that a friend\u2019s grasp of reality is a bit twisted at the moment, so you may have to steer them away from trouble. You could, of course, let them continue and learn from the experience but you don\u2019t want to see them get hurt."}, {"text": "The message of your birthday chart this year is that you should pay more attention to your inner voice. Always follow your hunches and never let anyone talk you out of doing something that you instinctively feel is right \u2013 you\u2019ll regret it if you do."}, {"text": "Someone you encounter on your travels today or tomorrow could become of huge importance to you later in the year, so be open and friendly with the people you meet and don\u2019t let first impressions put you off. What\u2019s in the heart is what matters."}, {"text": "Something you are told by a work colleague or someone in a position of authority will make you feel a lot better about what has been going on of late. Things are rarely as simple as they first seem, so if you did jump to conclusions, jump back again!"}, {"text": "You will find new reserves of energy and enthusiasm today and will try again to complete a project that you seemed to give up on a while ago. Approach it from a different angle this time \u2013 change your methods and the results will change as well."}, {"text": "News you receive from afar will improve your mood today, not least because you will realize that you have been worrying for no good reason \u2013 again. There is nothing wrong with your life in any way, except maybe how you choose to look at it."}, {"text": "Self-belief is the one thing you have never been short of and that\u2019s good because with so much cosmic activity taking place in your opposite sign you are sure to be challenged in some way today. Don\u2019t try to avoid the challenge, meet it head on."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to predict how someone is going to react to what you tell them today because they have no control over their own mind and emotions, and if they don\u2019t understand themselves it\u2019s unlikely you will understand them either."}, {"text": "You are projecting so many positive signals at the moment that the universe is responding by sending lots of goodies back at you. Both in your personal life and at work some wonderful things will occur over the next few days \u2013 and they\u2019re all for you!"}, {"text": "Good news about a family matter will cheer you up today but there is still an undercurrent of negativity about your attitude and you need to get over it. Try to accept the world for what it is \u2013 you can\u2019t change it but you can enjoy it."}, {"text": "Listen to what a friend has to tell you today because it could help you considerably. Sometimes you believe in yourself to such an extent that you take the kind of risks that even superheroes seek to avoid. You\u2019re not immortal or invincible Sag!"}, {"text": "You will do something so outrageous today that even those who know you best will think you have lost your head. On the contrary, you know exactly what you are doing \u2013 you are sending out a signal that you won\u2019t conform to other people\u2019s rules."}, {"text": "You have a talent for noticing things that other people have missed and what you see today can easily be turned to your advantage. You may be tempted to share what you know but if you do it may dilute its impact. It\u2019s for you alone to enjoy."}, {"text": "What you see and hear today won\u2019t exactly delight you but it\u2019s not the end of the world by any means, so don\u2019t overreact. There are more important things to worry about than a few friends who are making a mess of their lives."}, {"text": "Try not to see everything in terms of dollars and cents over the coming 12 months. Yes, of course, what you own and earn is important but they are worth next to nothing compared to the love you give out and the love you get back in return."}, {"text": "What are you so worried about? You should be having the time of your life. The sun in the friendship area of your chart at this time of year encourages you to get out into the world and make new friends, the kind who can make you smile."}, {"text": "Try not to come on too strong today, especially on the work front where you could easily fall out with someone in a position of authority. If you are having trouble getting along with them try working out why. There has to be a simple reason."}, {"text": "You are in a hugely positive frame of mind at the moment and long may it continue. The important thing is that you keep busy and keep telling yourself that no matter how many little things go wrong the big things will always go right for you."}, {"text": "There is no point getting involved in a war of words because the planets warn this is a battle that neither side can win. Also, avoid digging around in a friend\u2019s personal affairs. You may discover something you did not want to discover!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t give up on a relationship just because it is going through a bumpy patch. If you can get through to the weekend without scratching each other\u2019s eyes out there is every chance you can patch things up permanently \u2013 and yes, it is worth it!"}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to change your methods and routines just because someone you live or work with expects it of you. What right have they got to make such demands?

Lighten up Sag, it\u2019s life!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most materialistic area of your chart suggests you may get lucky where money is concerned. Even if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t be so worried about where your next dollar is going to come from. You\u2019ll survive, and thrive."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to keep your feelings under wraps but that\u2019s probably no bad thing. Others will respond more positively if you let them know what is going on in both your head and your heart \u2013 and the latter is of most importance."}, {"text": "Whether or not you enjoy the tasks you are called on to complete today depends entirely on your attitude.

Get involved Aquarius \u2013 make the world a better place through what you do in it."}, {"text": "It will pay you to be a bit more accepting of other people\u2019s beliefs and opinions. If you show that you support a friend or family member\u2019s need to be different they will repay you in ways that make life more interesting for you as well."}, {"text": "You need to overcome your fear of the unknown and do something that you have never been brave enough to do before.

This is one of those occasions when you will accomplish more by watching the world than by getting involved with it."}, {"text": "No matter how carefully you have drawn up your schedule something will happen that disrupts your plans.

Don\u2019t think of the people you interact with as rivals, think of them as friends and allies who have a vested interest in seeing you succeed."}, {"text": "Try not to overreact to criticism today because not only can it not hurt you but, if you listen carefully to what is being said, you could actually learn from it. Even an Aries makes mistakes once in a while, and sometimes only other people can see it."}, {"text": "With both Pluto and Saturn moving through one of the more important areas of your chart at the moment you must resist the temptation to make a big issue out of something that is probably quite trivial in nature. Aim to be positive in all situations."}, {"text": "You may think you need to give up on a project that has taken up a lot more time than you anticipated but don\u2019t be too hasty. The planets suggest that you are about to turn a corner, and what you need will be right in front of you."}, {"text": "You appear to have over-extended yourself in some way and now need to cut back on your workload.

Be ruthless."}, {"text": "With Saturn moving through one of the more realistic areas of your chart you won\u2019t be able to fool yourself, or other people, about what needs to be done and how hard it is going to be to do it.

It may look as if things are spiralling out of control but in a matter of days the situation will settle down and you will wonder why you allowed yourself to get so worked up about it."}, {"text": "It may seem as if every forward step you take has to be followed by two steps back but is that really so, or are you looking at the situation from an angle that makes things look worse than they are? It\u2019s the latter, of course, so quit worrying."}, {"text": "The more you try to change something the more it stays exactly the same as before. Can\u2019t you take a hint? Obviously, the cosmic powers that be don\u2019t want you to make changes, at least not yet. Bide your time Sag, and your time will come."}, {"text": "Saturn in your sign makes various tasks look harder than they really are, and you will need to keep reminding yourself of that fact if you are to make progress creatively and professionally. Also, learn from the mistakes that others have made before you."}, {"text": "It might be an idea to keep certain people at arm\u2019s length over the next 24 hours, simply because if you allow them to get too close they will distract you from what needs doing first. Mentally, emotionally and physically you need to keep yourself separate."}, {"text": "You may not find it easy to put your thoughts into words but it will be necessary if you are going to persuade others to back your plans. Keep your explanations simple and don\u2019t exaggerate what you hope to gain from what you aim to be doing."}, {"text": "The coming year will be full of challenges, and every one of them has a reason and a purpose. If you have ever wondered what you were put on this earth to do it could be you are about to find out. Do it lovingly and brilliantly!"}, {"text": "Over the next few days you will find yourself caught up in a battle of wits with someone whose stubbornness is a match for your own. Like it or not, it may be you who has to back down \u2013 or at least make a strategic withdrawal."}, {"text": "Take time to think things through before you actually do them. If you make too quick a decision today it could turn out to be the wrong one and it won\u2019t do your reputation much good. People expect you to be the one who thinks logically."}, {"text": "Avoid the temptation to put your faith in material things. If there is a gap in your life at the moment it has nothing to do with what you own or earn. More likely it is a spiritual longing that only a period of deep thought can resolve."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority will try to stop you doing what you want to be doing, and they may well succeed. So what do you do then? The one thing you don\u2019t do is lose your temper. That\u2019s exactly what they want to happen!"}, {"text": "In the greater scheme of things your problems are of little consequence and the sooner you recognize that fact the better. Whatever happens over the next few days, be it \u201cgood\u201d or be it \u201cbad\u201d, don\u2019t take it \u2013 or indeed yourself \u2013 too seriously."}, {"text": "Someone is watching you closely and hoping that you make a mistake.

Play it by the book today and make sure you are still in one piece to return to the fray again tomorrow."}, {"text": "You seem to be unusually suspicious at the moment. Why is that? Whatever the reason you need to get over it because with the sun moving into the final week of its stay in the most creative area of your chart every moment will be precious."}, {"text": "You may not be the sort of person who goes looking for trouble but if it finds you then you don\u2019t back down. That character trait will serve you well today as someone tries to turn the screw and get you to admit defeat. They\u2019re in for a shock."}, {"text": "You seem to doubt that what you are working on is going to succeed but the cosmic omens are still very much on your side \u2013 there is certainly no reason to be negative about your long-term prospects. Come on Sag, get up and get at \u2018em again!"}, {"text": "There may be no such thing as a free lunch but so many good things have landed in your lap of late that you are beginning to think you may be the exception to the rule. If you are, it won\u2019t last long, so make the most of it."}, {"text": "Something you said a while back will come back at you in some way today and chances are you will have to make amends \u2013 or even say sorry. If so, do it with good grace and then move on quickly. Make a clean break of it."}, {"text": "You should know by now that get-rich-quick schemes are invariably a waste of time and energy \u2013 and, yes, of money too. There are ways you can build wealth quickly but cutting corners and bending rules won\u2019t do it. Have a plan and work at it diligently."}, {"text": "There is nothing you cannot achieve. You have all the tools you need to make a success of the coming year, so banish doubt from your mind and get on with living your dream \u2013 and ignore the naysayers who warn it could turn into a nightmare. It won\u2019t."}, {"text": "You will be able to see more clearly today what is possible and what is not. Your natural can-do attitude will still be there but so too will be an added sense of realism. Logic plus hard work will make your big idea a big success."}, {"text": "No effort will be too much for you today \u2013 you will do whatever it takes to reach your goal. The idea of failure won\u2019t even enter your head \u2013 you instinctively know that if you give your all then you will get what it is you most desire."}, {"text": "You should find it a lot easier working with family and friends today. Your motives and methods may be different but you will be moving toward the same objective, so everyone will be willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good."}, {"text": "Help will arrive when you need it most today. Others will rally round and assist you in making a success of what might otherwise be a task that proves too much for you. Don\u2019t be too proud to accept the hand of friendship when it is offered."}, {"text": "Stick with the people you know you can trust and don\u2019t be tempted to join forces with those who share neither your general outlook on life nor your short-term aims. This is no time for taking chances \u2013 there is far too much at stake."}, {"text": "The truth is not just important, the truth is everything. That is the message of the stars today and if you heed it and demand honesty both of yourself and other people you will find that the truth works in your favour on every level."}, {"text": "You will find yourself under considerable pressure over the next few days, but if you stay calm and refuse to give in to panic you will be okay \u2013 and impress a lot of important people. When you\u2019re at war, self-confidence is half the battle."}, {"text": "You could probably have done more with an opening or opportunity that came your way around the turn of the year but don\u2019t worry about it. There will be more chances to shine over the next few weeks, so look forward, not back. "}, {"text": "This is an important time for you because the decisions you take over the next few days will change your life in numerous ways. If you want those ways to be for the better you must know your own mind. What is it you most desire?"}, {"text": "The planets suggest you are trying too hard to live up to other people\u2019s expectations. Common sense demands that you ignore what they want and focus exclusively on what feels right to you. It\u2019s your life Capricorn, so play it your way."}, {"text": "Plans you made weeks, months, maybe even years ago will pay off between now and the end of the month. Nothing you say or do or even think in life is ever lost \u2013 what goes around always comes around again. Never forget that."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t want to settle for second best then you will need to join forces with people who share your aims and ambitions. You don\u2019t have to be on the same wavelength exactly but you do need to be heading in the same general direction."}, {"text": "Mars links with your ruling planet Uranus on your birthday this year, giving you the energy to follow your special dream. Others may say you are expecting too much of yourself but you know that all things are possible \u2013 for you, at least!"}, {"text": "Something that is beyond your control is frustrating you to such an extent that there is a danger you could get angry about it. Don\u2019t! Your rivals are waiting for the right moment to take you on and if you lose your cool they could win."}, {"text": "You may not be one of the zodiac\u2019s more obvious dreamers \u2013 you are far too down-to-earth by nature to get carried away by flights of fancy \u2013 but your imagination will soar today. If you can think it you can do it \u2013 so believe it!"}, {"text": "It would appear there is someone in your social circle who is making such a nuisance of themselves that you want nothing more to do with them. Turn your back and walk away and don\u2019t feel guilty about leaving them behind. Feel relieved!"}, {"text": "Because you have been less than honest about the way you feel you may have given others the impression that you are calm and confident when, in fact, your emotions are raging. What happens today will bring your true feelings to the surface!"}, {"text": "If someone lets you down today \u2013 and the planets suggests strongly that they will \u2013 don\u2019t fly off the handle and get caught up in a battle of words. It\u2019s not what you say that matters but what you do. Make it obvious you no longer need them."}, {"text": "Someone will go all out to change your point of view about something today \u2013 and they will fail totally. You know what you know and you know what you believe and even if the facts don\u2019t always back you up you are not about to change!"}, {"text": "The only danger today is that other people may think you are being too pushy and expecting too much of them \u2013 and most likely you are. Unless you enjoy making enemies you might like to take your assertiveness down a notch or two. "}, {"text": "You have never been afraid to follow your instincts and if you follow them today there is every chance you will land a very big prize. On the work front especially good things will come your way if you are brave enough to take a risk."}, {"text": "You seem to be in a rather critical mood at the moment and because others can sense it they will most likely give you a very wide berth. No one likes to be told that they are wrong, least of all by someone as bluntly spoken as you!"}, {"text": "Minor disputes are inevitable today as Mars and Uranus lock horns in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart. Don\u2019t worry if a loved one flies off the handle. A day or two from now it will be all sweetness and light between you again. "}, {"text": "Routine tasks may be boring but that does not mean you can just ignore them. If you take that approach today not only will you have to do the same tasks later on but you won\u2019t have so much time for them, adding to the pressure. Finish them now!"}, {"text": "Focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else today. What is it that inspires you the most in life? What is it that delights you? Do that and nothing else. The only thing of any real importance is the thing that makes you happy."}, {"text": "This could be and should be the year when you finally make your mark in whatever field of endeavour is of most importance to you. Don\u2019t listen to what other people say you should be doing, listen to what your inner voice tells you \u2013 and act on it."}, {"text": "You may think you can get away with anything now, and maybe you can, in the short-term, but over a longer time scale your words and action are sure to bear fruit of one flavour or another. Remember, causes always have consequences."}, {"text": "You may have been at the service of other people in recent weeks but now that Mars, planet of ego and energy, is moving into your sign the roles will soon be reversed. You no longer have to take orders from those you do not respect."}, {"text": "There is a danger today that you will see problems where none truly exist, which in turn could make you reluctant to try new ways of doing things. Gemini is supposed to be an adventurous sign, so get past your fear and have some fun."}, {"text": "Just because you have the power to make people do things for you does not mean you should use it. And if you do use it you must make sure there is something in it for them, too. Remember, friendships, while fun, can at times be fragile, too."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks you don\u2019t have what it takes to reach the top of your chosen profession is going to be proven very wrong indeed over the next few weeks. With Mars moving through the career area of your chart there will be no stopping you."}, {"text": "According to the planets someone you work or do business with may not be operating with the same honesty as you are at the moment, so be on your guard and be ready to cut ties if you have to. Never be scared to go it alone."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t usually find it hard to live and let live, but something seems to be making you a little less forgiving than usual. No doubt you are right to have your doubts about someone but don\u2019t let it consume you mentally or emotionally."}, {"text": "The subtle approach is rarely your way \u2013 why should you watch what you say when what you say is always right? \u2013 but it will pay you to be a bit more careful with your use of words today. You\u2019ve got enough opponents \u2013 you don\u2019t need more!"}, {"text": "You may think you have found an easy way to cut your workload, but if it involves trickery or deceit of any kind it could rebound on you later. There is only one surefire way to get it all done today: Start early and work late."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you as energy planet Mars moves into the most dynamic and creative area of your chart. Don\u2019t let fear of failure hold you back, because every failure will be followed by a dozen successes."}, {"text": "Some people seem to have a knack for making a drama out of a crisis and one such individual will give you a hard time today. Whatever else you do don\u2019t let their emotional behaviour get to you. Stay calm. Laughter is more effective than lashing out."}, {"text": "Mars moves into the communications area of your chart today, making it easier for you to find the right words in most situations. You need to be aware though that you may at times sound unnecessarily harsh. Be assertive but not aggressive."}, {"text": "Your birthday charts warns that over the coming 12 months you will have to deal with people who appear to believe you exist purely for their convenience. Let them know that you won\u2019t put up with it. Move away or take a new job if you have to."}, {"text": "Try not to take anything too seriously today because if you do you could end up going to extremes and saying something that will come back at you at some point in the future. If you can\u2019t talk nice Aries, don\u2019t talk at all!"}, {"text": "According to the planets you will be put to the test over the next two or three days. What occurs may not be to your liking but you have the drive and the determination (not to mention the stubbornness) to overcome any and all opposition."}, {"text": "Try to vary your routine a bit. Because you have been doing the same old things in the same old ways for so long it\u2019s not a surprise that you are getting bored with them. Even a small change in your daily doings could have hugely beneficial results."}, {"text": "The next two or three days could will see a number of disruptions but the good news is that once you\u2019ve got past them one of the very best times of the year will get under way. You have so much to look forward to, so cheer up!"}, {"text": "If you ask a friend or a family member to do you a favour today they will go out of their way to assist you. Bear in mind though that it puts you in their debt. Later in the month they will expect you to help them in return."}, {"text": "Your rivals and competitors seem to be doing everything in their power to slow you down but they cannot succeed in stopping you altogether, so keep doing what you are doing and don\u2019t let their behaviour deflect you from your chosen course."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try too hard to impress other people today \u2013 let them come to you for a change. If you make out that you don\u2019t really care what they think of you it may, in a perverse sort of way, encourage them to think better of you. People are strange."}, {"text": "If someone you work with annoys you today you must let them know that you are not going to put up with their foolish behaviour. As for their opinions, well, someone needs to remind them of the difference between fact and fiction. Can you be bothered?"}, {"text": "It\u2019s good of you to be concerned about a friend or colleague who has troubles in their private life but unless they actually ask you to get involved you should keep your distance. This is one of those situations they need to resolve for themselves."}, {"text": "You must be honest with a friend who has made a poor job of something and is now looking for sympathy. Yes, of course, you can and you should console them, but they need to face facts and, most importantly, face up to their own failings."}, {"text": "Someone you have dealings with, either in your social life or at work, is being far too domineering at the moment and it\u2019s quite likely you will fall out with them before the end of the day. That\u2019s good. Let them know you won\u2019t be pushed around."}, {"text": "The sun is nearing the end of its journey through the most sensitive area of your chart and in a matter of days your outlook will brighten considerably. Between now and then make an extra effort not to give in to despair. Believe life is worth living!"}, {"text": "You have the potential to achieve some amazing things over the coming year, but you could just as easily slip back into your old, easygoing ways and achieve nothing at all. It\u2019s your life and your choice, of course, but wouldn\u2019t you rather be a winner?"}, {"text": "Now is the time to explain yourself to other people, not least because you finally have a clear idea of what it is you want and what you need to do to get it. Communication is the key to success this weekend, so speak loud and speak proud."}, {"text": "If you think someone needs help, either in their personal life or at work, don\u2019t hesitate to step in and ask them if you can be of assistance. They will jump at the chance to have someone with a cool head like yours to guide them."}, {"text": "You feel a lot better about yourself now and that\u2019s good, but it doesn\u2019t mean you can ignore the things that made you feel bad before, because they have not completely gone away. Be on your guard this weekend Gemini \u2013 just in case."}, {"text": "Something you hear in your working environment may cause you some anxiety but the planets suggest you don\u2019t have to worry at all. If something bad does occur it won\u2019t have anything to do with you, so relax \u2013 you\u2019re much too tense!"}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority may give you a hard time for no good reason this weekend and, of course, your first reaction will be to hit back at them. Don\u2019t. Pretend you are not fazed in the slightest. That will hurt them 10 times more!"}, {"text": "Everyone around you wants to do one thing but you want to do something completely different. So do it. You may not want to be a party pooper but for your own peace of mind you must go off and do your own thing this weekend."}, {"text": "Do something you really enjoy over the next 48 hours, something that brings a smile to your face and makes you feel good about life. You\u2019ve made more than your share of sacrifices of late, so reward yourself \u2013 because no one else will!"}, {"text": "The difference between success and failure this weekend will be determined by how quickly you can react to events. Don\u2019t waste time trying to weigh up all the pros and cons, just go with your first thought or feeling and see where it takes you."}, {"text": "There have been times in recent weeks when it seemed as if you were no longer master of your own fate, but looking back you can see that certain things had to happen for your own good. Learn from them and move on. The future is bright."}, {"text": "You will learn something that your rivals, both at work and in your private life, don\u2019t want you to know. How you make use of this information is up to you but try to be positive about it. Certainly don\u2019t embarrass people for the fun of it."}, {"text": "As the sun will shortly be moving into the financial area of your chart you won\u2019t lack for money to buy stuff, but don\u2019t go overboard and waste your hard-earned cash on things you don\u2019t really need. Save a few dollars for the proverbial rainy day."}, {"text": "You are in the mood to start something new but if you are smart you will wait until the second half of next week when the full moon in your opposite sign begins to fade. What\u2019s the rush? You\u2019ve got plenty of time to make your mark."}, {"text": "There will be no end of surprises in your life over the next 12 months and most of them will be the kind of surprises you thoroughly enjoy. But don\u2019t sit there waiting for life to entertain you \u2013 get out into the world and surprise others with your dynamism."}, {"text": "If you feel a bit emotional today don\u2019t let it show. There is a lot of negativity around at the moment and if you allow yourself to get caught up in it there is no telling where it might lead. Do something that makes you feel good about life."}, {"text": "You may have an endless supply of good ideas but that does not mean other people are going to go along with everything you suggest. If you want to increase your chances of success then take just one idea and polish it until it really shines."}, {"text": "Try not to take criticism personally over the next two or three days, especially when dealing with people in positions of authority. Yes, some of the things they say may be unfair, but most of what they say will be very good advice, so heed it."}, {"text": "CANCER (June 22 - July 23):"}, {"text": "Other people will be amazed by how quickly and confidently you act today, not least because you have been reluctant to get involved in issues that don\u2019t seem to have obvious solutions. The cosmic picture is changing, and you are changing too."}, {"text": "You may not have any choice about what you are expected to do today, but you do have a choice about how you do it. Force yourself to be enthusiastic and aim for excellence in small things as well as large. The universe will love you for it."}, {"text": "Make sure partners and loved ones are aware how much you appreciate the efforts they have made for you since the start of the year. You may not always be open about your views and opinions but you do feel gratitude. Demonstrate that today."}, {"text": "The next few days are going to be busy, so busy in fact that you probably won\u2019t have time for social events unless they are directly connected to your work. Put everything into your career and believe you are destined for greater things, because you are."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s change of signs on Wednesday will transform the way you look at the world and it won\u2019t be long before you understand that it\u2019s your own mental attitude that shapes the future. Make a point of seeing the bright side of each and every situation."}, {"text": "Certain individuals may be hard to get along with at the moment but give it time and they should mellow enough for you to actually start liking them again. If you can, limit your contact with them between now and the sun\u2019s change of signs on Wednesday."}, {"text": "You sometimes find it difficult to adapt to situations that are new to you and which confuse you in some way, but today you should find it quite easy to move with the ebb and flow of events. Don\u2019t try to control life \u2013 let it guide you."}, {"text": "The sun is coming to the end of its annual trip through your sign, so if there are any projects you want to start now would be a good time. You will still be able to start them later, but it may take more time and effort to get moving."}, {"text": "The higher you aim now the more you will achieve over the next few weeks. Look at your plans and find areas where you can upgrade them, even if you doubt you have what it takes to compete at that level. You will not only compete, you will win."}, {"text": "A sun-Uranus link on your birthday this year suggests you will be attracted to people, places and situations that are in some way out of the ordinary. You can sense there is more to life than meets the eye and you are determined to find out what it is."}, {"text": "Keep things simple and you will find you enjoy life a lot more. The sun\u2019s move into the most sensitive area of your chart may make you worry that you are not doing enough, but even if that is true you are still doing more than most."}, {"text": "Even a Taurus needs friends and the planets indicate you will need them more than ever over the next few days. But that does not mean anything bad is going to happen. On the contrary, there are some wonderful new opportunities coming your way. Be ready for them."}, {"text": "Set your sights high over the coming week \u2013 then go higher still. The sun\u2019s move into the area of your chart that governs your reputation and place in society will encourage you to make the most of the talents you were born with \u2013 and you were born with plenty."}, {"text": "One of the very best times of the year starts today as the sun moves into the most adventurous area of your chart. If you dream of expanding your horizons in any way \u2013 physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually \u2013 now is the time to stop dreaming and start doing."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you feel a bit off the pace as the new week begins. At this time of year it\u2019s quite natural for you to be a bit world weary. Just relax and don\u2019t push yourself if you don\u2019t feel like it. You\u2019ll be back to normal soon."}, {"text": "Hopefully you\u2019re not the sort to get annoyed over what other people say, because some of the comments which come your way today could be a touch unflattering. If you react it will only encourage them to say more, so pretend you don\u2019t care."}, {"text": "Life is complicated enough without you agreeing to take on other people\u2019s responsibilities as well as your own. The sun in the work and well-being area of your chart over the next few weeks will find ways to remind you that your health always comes first."}, {"text": "Make sure you get what you deserve today. Some people may try to give you considerably less but they can only succeed if you fail to stand up to them. Bare your teeth and snarl a bit. They\u2019ll get the message. You can be quite intimidating at times!"}, {"text": "What seemed like an unlucky break yesterday will reveal itself to be highly beneficial today. Take that as an omen for the next few weeks. Sometimes when things look bad they are in fact very good indeed. You just need to look with the right sort of eyes."}, {"text": "Stay focused on your primary objective today and don\u2019t get distracted by things that may look interesting but are in reality a complete waste of time and energy. You know what it is you want most from life and you must not rest until you have got it."}, {"text": "Concentrate on something you enjoy today, because later in the week you will be neck deep in the kind of serious stuff that leaves no time for fun and games. Let your hair down and have some fun \u2013 it may be a while before you get another chance!"}, {"text": "The sun moves into your sign today and a new solar year begins. It may not be true that what you do today will colour the coming 12 months to any great extent but act as if it will. Get into the habit of being both happy and productive."}, {"text": "You will be deeply involved with partnership issues over the coming 12 months, so involved in fact that you may at times neglect your own ego interests. It\u2019s not all about other people, it\u2019s about you as well, so remember to do what makes you happy occasionally."}, {"text": "A month from now the sun will move into your sign and you will be back to your best. Between now and then try looking back over the past year or so and learn what lessons you can. Above all, recognize just how silly your fears have been."}, {"text": "Take what other people tell you with a large pinch of salt. Today\u2019s full moon warns you cannot believe everything you hear \u2013 also, that some people\u2019s opinions about what you are doing are designed not to build you up but to knock you down."}, {"text": "You will learn something to your benefit today, most likely something to do with your career. You should have learnt it much earlier but for one reason or another you missed the signals and carried on as before. You\u2019re getting a second chance \u2013 don\u2019t waste it."}, {"text": "You will improve your chances of success considerably if you are willing to look further afield for your opportunities in life. With the sun now moving through the sympathetic sign of Pisces you can afford to be a bit more adventurous. Seize the moment."}, {"text": "To make the most of your talents and opportunities you first need to get your financial house in order and today\u2019s full moon will assist you by forcing you to face up to the realities of your cash-flow situation. Don\u2019t be so wasteful in future Leo."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s full moon will make it feel as if you are no longer in control of events, as if you are having to dance to everyone\u2019s tune but your own. That may be true but there\u2019s a reason for it. You are being guided in a more positive direction."}, {"text": "You will find it easier to focus on details today and you will discover that some people have been feeding you false information. Don\u2019t get angry with them. Just resolve that in future you will do your own research and come to your own conclusions."}, {"text": "There will be so many opportunities to enjoy yourself over the next few days and you must take advantage of them. Also, spend as much time as you can with partners and loved ones because it is through them that your biggest opportunities will arrive."}, {"text": "Do not \u2013 repeat, do not \u2013 play a role to please other people. You are who you are for a good cosmic reason and even though you have made some mistakes your destiny is to carry on making your own choices \u2013 and, yes, your own mistakes, too."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be afraid to give voice to your views and opinions. The current full moon will sweep away restrictions that have been holding you back from speaking up and now you must go to the other extreme and shout loud and long about what you believe."}, {"text": "You have been worrying too much about money and business matters and need to get past the idea that what you own and earn has a direct bearing on who you are and what you can do in life. It\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about passion and dedication."}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s full moon takes place in your opposite sign you will probably get emotional about something quite trivial. Try to keep your feelings in check but, if they do get out of hand, forgive yourself for it later in the week when you\u2019ve calmed down."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t fear change, embrace it. You will get the chance to go places and do things over the coming 12 months that can transform your life in so many ways, but it is you who must make the decision to move forward rather than stay where you are now."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that you will trade less than friendly words with someone you live or work with today but it\u2019s no big deal \u2013 in fact it will be forgotten almost immediately. Everyone falls out occasionally, even the best of friends, so don\u2019t turn it into a war."}, {"text": "If someone offers you something for nothing today you will, of course, be suspicious, but the planets indicate there is no hidden motive involved. At worst they are doing you a favour now so they can ask one of you later on \u2013 and there is nothing wrong with that."}, {"text": "There are so many interesting things going on around you at the moment, so don\u2019t waste time on trivialities or trying to get ahead of rivals in small but unimportant ways. Expand your awareness to embrace the whole wide world. What you see will delight you."}, {"text": "You may be finding it hard to get through to loved ones, thanks to the influence of Saturn in your opposite sign, but Mercury, planet of communication, will come to your rescue today. You may only find your voice for a few minutes but you\u2019ll say a lot."}, {"text": "Listen to what a friend has to tell you today and if what they say has financial implications for you personally you must act on it immediately. If you don\u2019t take advantage of the situation you can be sure one of your many rivals will. Be first. Be best."}, {"text": "Weigh your options carefully before making a move today. According to the planets there is a possibility that a rival or competitor has set up a trap for you and is expecting you to stumble into it with both eyes closed. You\u2019re nowhere near that stupid though."}, {"text": "You know exactly what you should be doing, so get on and do it and don\u2019t worry about the consequences. Life will go well for you if you trust your instincts and don\u2019t overthink what might happen tomorrow or next week. Act first and don\u2019t worry about it later."}, {"text": "If you ask a friend or family member what they think about what you are doing it is more than likely that their response will be negative. So don\u2019t ask them. Have the courage of your convictions today and follow the path that feels right for you."}, {"text": "People you work with and for are impressed by your attitude and application and there is every possibility that some kind of offer, or maybe even a promotion, will be coming your way very soon. Keep at it and keep your reputation right up there where it belongs."}, {"text": "Sometimes you love the limelight and sometimes it scares you and sometimes you just cannot be bothered to put on a show to make other people happy. Today\u2019s Mercury-Saturn link suggests you need to be alone for a while \u2013 so, no big performance today."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication, is on good form today, making it easier than usual to get your message across. You must, however, be selective about whom you speak with and what you choose to tell them. Don\u2019t waste your breath on trivial people and trivial events."}, {"text": "You will take an original approach to a familiar problem today and will be amazed how quickly you find a solution. Is it because circumstances have changed? No, it\u2019s because you have changed your way of thinking. By shifting your focus you understand the issue better."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t sit back and wait for good things to come to you over the coming 12 months \u2013 they will, but not to the extent that will make you happy. Get out into the world and make things happen. Be the kind of Pisces who always takes the lead."}, {"text": "The sun is now moving through the most sensitive sector of your chart, so most likely you will be in a thoughtful mood today. And that\u2019s good because the more you think the less likely it is you will make the kind of snap decision that attracts trouble."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t get discouraged if the results you were hoping for have yet to come through. There is still a bit to be done before you get the breakthrough you so strongly desire. Today, make friends with people whose dreams and schemes reflect your own."}, {"text": "If you find that you are under pressure today it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. The sun in the career area of your chart means you want to make a good impression. That\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t expect too much of yourself."}, {"text": "The sun in the sympathetic sign of Pisces indicates that so many of the things that have been worrying you will soon fade away. Chances are most of them never existed in the first place, but the important thing is you now feel free to enjoy yourself."}, {"text": "The focus is still on partnerships but of a less personal nature. Matters to do with money, investments and business will be top of your agenda over the next few weeks and if you play your cards right there is every chance you could make a handsome profit."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try to keep things from partners and loved ones. It won\u2019t work, not least because the planets suggest they know at least half the story already. You are strongly advised to be truthful about what you\u2019ve been up to \u2013 and what you intend to do next."}, {"text": "Life seems to have taken a more serious turn of late but that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot have fun. You will, however, have to focus more on work and health issues over the next three or four weeks. Do whatever is takes to keep yourself in good shape."}, {"text": "The sun in Pisces at this time of year makes it easier for you to do things of a creative nature, so identify what it is that attracts you the most and then get on with it. Don\u2019t waste time making detailed plans \u2013 let your inner voice guide you."}, {"text": "If you do a favour for someone now they will do no end of favours for you later on when the roles are reversed and it is you who needs some kind of assistance. Most of all, focus on getting your home life sorted \u2013 everything else depends on that."}, {"text": "This is a great time for travelling and socializing and generally having a good time. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have much money to spare at the moment because fate will provide when you need it most. Enjoy other people\u2019s company as much as they enjoy yours."}, {"text": "Your head may be full of good ideas but how many of them will amount to anything? Make this the day you get your act together and decide, once and for all, where you are going to focus your energy. Do just one thing really well."}, {"text": "A little bit of effort will go a long way now the sun is established in your sign, so forget about all the negative things that have happened and believe with all your heart that you are destined for great things. Then apply yourself with energy and enthusiasm."}, {"text": "A Mercury-Jupiter link on your birthday means you need to take command of your thoughts \u2013 because if you don\u2019t they could lead you off in some rather weird directions. Be open to new ideas, but only use those you know without a doubt to be true."}, {"text": "Take your time and make a good job of what you are working on. Under no circumstances allow colleagues or employers to pressure you into completing tasks faster than you think is wise. Getting it right the first time is of the utmost importance."}, {"text": "You will be asked to do something today that you really don\u2019t want to do, but according to the planets you will have little choice in the matter. Don\u2019t just go through the motions though \u2013 make an effort and make a really good job of it."}, {"text": "Just because you have the power to make people do what you want them to do does not mean you must use it. Bear that thought in mind today before you start barking orders like a sergeant-major. Co-operation works better than coercion in the long-term."}, {"text": "This is the ideal day to sit down with a pen and a piece of paper and map out your plans for the next few months. If you find yourself torn between competing goals and timetables, go with the one that attracted you first. Trust your instincts."}, {"text": "If a colleague promises you all kinds of goodies today if you do something for them you will be inclined to believe them. Why? Because they are physically so attractive. Really Leo, if it\u2019s that easy to persuade you maybe you deserve to be cheated!"}, {"text": "If someone gives you a hard time today you must not give them a hard time in return. Just turn your back and walk away and don\u2019t waste any more thoughts or feelings on them. Whatever the issues between you they are not worth getting worked up about."}, {"text": "The planets warn you are paying too much attention to what other people are saying and not enough attention to your own inner voice. The answers you are looking for are inside your head, so slow your thoughts right down and let inspiration come through."}, {"text": "You need to be on your guard today. Even when dealing with people you think you can trust you would be wise to check the facts and figures they give to you before you act on them. There is no guarantee they know what they are talking about."}, {"text": "Your mind seems to be moving a bit slowly at the moment. That can only mean that you are mentally tired and need to give your brain a rest. Forget about serious subjects and find something to do that you enjoy but which does not require much thought."}, {"text": "If you keep your wits about you today you will gain from someone else\u2019s stupidity. That may sound immoral but the fact is if they choose to do something in a slapdash fashion then you are quite entitled to do it better and get rewarded for it."}, {"text": "Because Mercury, planet of the mind, is at odds with Jupiter, planet of exaggeration, today you would be wise to question everything you see and hear. That applies especially to anything to do with money matters and business issues. You cannot afford to take risks."}, {"text": "You have something to say that you suspect won\u2019t go down well in certain quarters. Too bad, say it anyway. This is your time of year and you are entitled to speak your mind. Later on you may be thanked for your words of wisdom \u2013 or maybe not!"}, {"text": "Venus, planet of harmony, and Pluto, planet of transformation, join forces on your birthday this year \u2013 a combination that makes all things possible for you over the coming 12 months. What is the one thing you are most passionate about? Turn that passion into power."}, {"text": "Venus and Pluto join forces in the career area of your chart today, which suggests you will be passionately involved in doing something that means a great deal to you personally. Don\u2019t let it get so personal though that others find it hard to join in and help you."}, {"text": "Positive thinking is a must this weekend, especially if you are one of those people who tends to dwell on what went wrong in the past rather than look forward to what might go right in the future. Get out into the world and do something you really enjoy."}, {"text": "You seem to be getting criticism from all directions at the moment but there is no reason to worry about it. Some people just like finding fault (Virgos especially!) and what they say must not be allowed to influence your thinking or what you do in the world."}, {"text": "Whatever feuds or fallings out you may have had with partners and loved ones over the past few weeks you must now put them behind you and move on together. Make the first move. Say sorry and mean it. That\u2019s probably all it will take."}, {"text": "This is an exceptionally busy time for you, so you need to find ways to stay healthy in mind, body and spirit. Set aside a little time this weekend to slow things right down and to remind yourself of the many things you have to be thankful for."}, {"text": "A Venus-Pluto union in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart this weekend means you can charm the birds from the trees, if that\u2019s what turns you on. Talking of being turned on, this is also a potentially amazing time for affairs of the heart!"}, {"text": "Family matters and domestic issues should go well for you over the next 48 hours and even if you fell out with someone in your home environment recently it won\u2019t be hard to kiss and make up. You have too much in common to stay angry for long."}, {"text": "Trust your instincts this weekend, even if almost everyone you know is telling you to do the opposite of what your inner voice whispers. Ultimately, only you know what is best for your long-term happiness and security, so only you can make the really important decisions."}, {"text": "Someone you work with or maybe bump into socially occasionally is about to become a bigger part of your life than you thought possible. The friendship you form has the potential to last a lifetime, because both of you are focused on the same goals."}, {"text": "Venus in your sign links with power planet Pluto today, so if you need to get important things done this is the time. No matter how challenging life may get you will handle everything that happens with ease. You\u2019re a serious player, and a winner too."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to trust a certain person but what choice do you have? The planets indicate that only they can help you get from where you are now to where you most want to be, so put your doubts behind you and move forward together."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t much care what happens this weekend because you are so in the zone, physically, mentally and emotionally, that you know you can handle whatever life chooses to throw in your direction. You have what it takes to win and you know it!"}, {"text": "One of the things you need to do over the coming year is to make sure you are rewarded at the correct level for what you do for other people. That applies not only to your work but also to more personal relations. It cannot be all give and no take."}, {"text": "You may not much enjoy what you are expected to do today but do it to the best of your abilities anyway. If you make believe it is the most interesting task in the world you may be surprised to discover it\u2019s not so bad after all."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the friendship area of your chart encourages you to get involved in a program that brings like-minded people together. What is it that motivates you the most to do good in the world? Seek out those who share the same purpose."}, {"text": "If you want to get ahead this week you will need to cut back on the talk and get down to some serious work. A more conciliatory approach will be necessary too, especially when dealing with people whose aims appear to be at odds with your own."}, {"text": "This is a highly positive time of year for you and if you make the most of it you can\u2019t help but move ahead in leaps and bounds. Travel opportunities will become available early next month, so pack a bag so you can move at a moment\u2019s notice."}, {"text": "A money-making offer may sound too good to be true but the planets indicate it is on the level, so get serious about it and don\u2019t be afraid to get involved. Check the facts and figures first, of course, but don\u2019t let self-doubt stop you from acting."}, {"text": "You may be inclined to give up on a relationship that has been going through some bumpy times but give it a bit longer because things will get better. You may ultimately decide to go your separate ways but at least you will have given it one last chance."}, {"text": "You seem to be under the impression that you need to change your methods. That\u2019s wrong. In fact, your current way of doing things is exactly right for you, so resist the urge to change for the sake of it and make what you already do work even better."}, {"text": "Moderation is essential over the next few days, especially if you are the sort of Scorpio who happily goes to extremes when things are going well for you. The sun in Pisces does wonders for your self-belief, but you need to mix it with plenty of common sense."}, {"text": "People will go out of their way to help you over the next few days, even when you probably don\u2019t deserve it. Never doubt that you are respected by those you work with, and loved by those you live with. And don\u2019t neglect to give respect and love back."}, {"text": "You appear to be worrying about something that is of only minor importance in the greater scheme of things. It may be the case that you fear you are about to let someone down, but the fact is you can and you must put your own interests first."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most materialistic area of your chart will encourage you to focus more time and energy on what you own and earn, and that\u2019s a good thing. The fact is you have been neglecting your financial situation of late, so get it sorted now."}, {"text": "The sun in your sign over the next few weeks will encourage you to be more outgoing, but as mind planet Mercury is moving retrograde, also in your sign, you will need to be careful when dealing with people for the first time. Don\u2019t be too trusting."}, {"text": "Creative and artistic activities will go very well indeed over the coming year, so don\u2019t limit yourself in any way, shape or form. Put a name to your dream and go after it with every fibre of your being. There is no doubt at all that your dream will come true."}, {"text": "Duty calls as the new week begins and being the sort who takes your responsibilities seriously you won\u2019t hesitate to answer. Just make sure that what you do for other people is what they genuinely cannot do for themselves. Your mother didn\u2019t raise you to be a fool."}, {"text": "Almost certainly you will run out of patience with someone you work with today, and that\u2019s a very good thing. You need to let them know that you won\u2019t be taken for a ride, not by them, not by anyone. No more mister nice guy!"}, {"text": "Someone will try to win you round to their way of thinking today but it will be clear right from the start that your minds are moving in very different directions. Thank them for their input, then do what you know to be right. Think for yourself."}, {"text": "You like to be of assistance and help people who are struggling, but today you will go to the other extreme and do only what makes you happy, regardless of how it might make other people feel. Try not to be too cold-hearted about it though."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t want much to do with the world as the new week begins, so find a quiet and secluded place where you can be on your own. Usually you enjoy having people around you but today you desire only the company of your own thoughts."}, {"text": "Before you get angry with a colleague for getting something wrong today make sure they really have got it wrong. The planets warn you could easily get the wrong end of the stick over the next 24 hours. Don\u2019t give others an excuse to beat you with it!"}, {"text": "You may have to deal with someone today who you don\u2019t much like but you are advised to ignore your feelings and get on with it because there are things they can do for you that you cannot do for yourself. You can at least pretend to be friendly."}, {"text": "There will be times today when you get the impression that certain individuals are being deliberately obstructive \u2013 and you\u2019re right, they are. Don\u2019t let them see that you have noticed though. Play along as if nothing has happened. Your opportunity for revenge will come soon enough."}, {"text": "You have a habit of rushing in where angels fear to tread and usually it pays off for you. However, the planets warn that if you jump into the unknown today you may end up landing in something unpleasant \u2013 and that\u2019s if you land at all!"}, {"text": "No matter what size the task you face and no matter how much the odds may be stacked against you there is not the slightest doubt that you will come through. You are at your best when faced with a challenge that only the toughest and brightest can handle."}, {"text": "If you are not in the mood for work today then don\u2019t force yourself. Others may say you have urgent business to take care of but you know it can wait until another day. Ease yourself into the week \u2013 you can build up speed and momentum later on."}, {"text": "No doubt you feel you could take on the world and win, but why go to all that trouble when the things you need, the things that will make you truly happy, are much closer to home? Spend some quality time with the people you love today."}, {"text": "It is essential that you have some kind of plan for the coming year. It does not have to be too detailed, but it does have to provide you with an overall goal or objective so you can be sure that you are always moving in the right direction."}, {"text": "Force yourself to do something exciting today. You may not be in the mood to get out into the world and put yourself about a bit but the planets indicate that if you make the effort you will enjoy yourself immensely. Don\u2019t think about it, just do it."}, {"text": "Some things are changing quite rapidly now and there is nothing you can do to stop it happening. But why would you want to when the changes are likely to benefit you? Ask yourself how you can start making those changes work in your favour. Then act."}, {"text": "If you get dragged into a dispute with someone who is stronger or better connected than you then it is inevitable that you will lose, so keep your temper in check and back off a bit if things get a bit heated. You don\u2019t have to win every time."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to apologize for something you said \u2013 not if you meant it. You are entitled to speak your mind even if people in positions of authority disagree with you. Diversity of opinion is a must, so speak up and ruffle a few feathers."}, {"text": "The more you worry about your cash-flow problems, the less likely it is you will find a solution, so cheer up and start believing that the right opportunity will come along at just the right time. Before you know it the money will be coming in again."}, {"text": "If you find it hard to look on the bright side of life at the moment then get out into the world and mix with people whose outlook is more positive than your own. With any luck some of their cheery nature will rub off on you."}, {"text": "There is a danger at the moment that you think you have to be first in everything you do. Why is that a danger? Because it encourages you to try too hard. You are at your best when everything feels balanced and easygoing, so why put pressure on yourself?"}, {"text": "The winds of change are blowing strongly now and the good news is they are at your back and pushing you in a direction that is right for you in every way. So sit back, relax and enjoy the journey. You\u2019re sure to end up some place good."}, {"text": "You may feel a bit lost and insecure at the moment but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s times like these that make the good times feel even better, so hunker down some place quiet where you won\u2019t be disturbed and wait for the cosmic outlook to change. It will, very soon."}, {"text": "The message of the stars today is that you should keep things simple, both in your private life and at work. Be careful while on the move as travel plans could easily go wrong. If you take a wrong turn there is no telling where you might end up."}, {"text": "Like it or not you will have to let go of something you don\u2019t want to let go of today. It may be a painful process but it won\u2019t be long before you realize that you never really needed it and that it was blocking off other possibilities."}, {"text": "The sun in your sign forms a tense aspect to Pluto, planet of power, today. What that suggests is that you need to tread carefully when dealing with authority figures. What you say and do may be in jest but it\u2019s unlikely they will see it that way."}, {"text": "Your task for the coming year is to learn to see the world through different eyes. You don\u2019t have to change your own outlook, but you do have to develop the ability to see things from other people\u2019s point of view. If you can do that you will thrive."}, {"text": "You may not be at your best now but there is plenty you can do to make life more enjoyable. To start with try to forget about a recent falling out with a friend. It\u2019s not important, so get past it and move on, together or on your own."}, {"text": "You seem to be in one of your happy-go-lucky moods at the moment and that\u2019s great, but bear in mind that not everyone will share your positive outlook on life. One particular individual \u2013 a friend or a work colleague \u2013 could do with some upbeat advice."}, {"text": "Anyone who pokes their nose in your affairs today is going to seriously regret it. You don\u2019t need advice and you certainly don\u2019t need people you feel superior to telling you what should be done. Tell them \u2013 as nicely as you can \u2013 to get lost. "}, {"text": "It may not be easy to work out if someone is being serious or if they are joking but, to be safe, take what you are told with a large pinch of salt and make sure they know you are not going to act on what they are telling you."}, {"text": "Focus on the one thing you do best today. Leo is a larger-than-life sign and if you are typical of your kind you want nothing more than to do things that bring you recognition and rewards. Get creative today \u2013 it could pay off in a very big way."}, {"text": "You need to remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things your everyday problems don\u2019t mean a great deal. Take a look at the bigger picture today. Better still, take a look at the world and how the other half lives. You\u2019re one of the lucky ones."}, {"text": "Chances are you will find yourself at serious odds with someone you live or work with today and there is not much you can do about it. The simple fact is you are such different characters that it would be best if you interacted as little as possible."}, {"text": "Stay alert over the next 24 hours because unexpected events are sure to disrupt your plans. On the plus side, one of those events will unsettle the status quo to such an extent that it creates no end of opportunities for you personally. Take advantage of them."}, {"text": "Dealing with other people\u2019s problems will take up a large slice of your time and energy today but you must not think of it as a chore. The fact that you are in a position to help people means the universe is working through you to do good things."}, {"text": "By all means get tough with someone who is not pulling their weight but don\u2019t go too far and make an enemy of them. The planets warn if you rant and rave it will, in the long-term, have the opposite effect to what you desire. Calm down Capricorn!"}, {"text": "What feels right to you may not feel right to others and if you keep that fact in mind today you are less likely to fall out with people who should be your friends. Let them know that, whatever your differences, you will always support them in their choices. "}, {"text": "The planets indicate that you are going places. What does that actually mean? Well, it could mean you will be on the move in the physical sense but more likely it means you will be moving up in the world in the estimation of important people"}, {"text": "A sun-Mars link on your birthday means you will be in sparkling form over the coming year. Your confidence is such that you will attempt things that lesser mortals find too challenging. For you though the challenge is what it\u2019s all about!"}, {"text": "If you make an effort to be enthusiastic about something you would rather not be doing today you may in fact thoroughly enjoy it. You will also impress the people you work with and for by your dedication to duty. Always keep your standards high."}, {"text": "Take a look back over the past few months and ask yourself how many of the things you feared would happen did in fact occur. Hardly any of them, right? With that knowledge in mind stop worrying about tomorrow \u2013 it will be great."}, {"text": "If someone tries to belittle your efforts it can only be because they are jealous of your ability to get things done. In other words they resent you being so good at your job. Make it your aim today to add to that resentment."}, {"text": "If there is something you have wanted to do for ages but for one reason or another never quite got around to, do it now. While the sun is moving through the most adventurous area of your chart you can and you must be more active."}, {"text": "Money matters should be going well for you now \u2013 you are certainly less inclined to worry about your cash-flow situation. But don\u2019t go from one extreme to the other and start spending money like you have a never-ending supply of the stuff."}, {"text": "Your luck is on the turn and in a matter of days you will be enjoying a much more rewarding phase. The way you choose to think and feel will have a lot to do with it too. Be positive at all times and in all situations."}, {"text": "The next few days will be fortunate for you and what you gain you will deserve. Not everyone will agree that is so but what other people think is of no concern. If the winds of fate blow good things your way it is your duty to enjoy them."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to bet against the odds today and, who knows, you might win big. But the planets warn it\u2019s more likely you will lose and regret having taken such an unnecessary gamble. Keep your money in your pocket for now."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t feel bad about it if you gain from someone else\u2019s loss today. Everyone has their good days and their bad days and if you are one of the lucky ones who is doing okay at the moment then your only obligation is to enjoy it."}, {"text": "You seem to believe that others are out to get you, that people you interact with are plotting to make money at your expense \u2013 but it isn\u2019t true. Saturn\u2019s influence is having a negative effect on your thinking at the moment. Choose to ignore it."}, {"text": "Good fortune is heading rapidly in your direction and although you may find that hard to believe in your present situation it is undoubtedly true, so try to stay positive and be on the lookout for the telltale signs that announce better days."}, {"text": "No matter what tales of woe you hear from other people today you are advised to take them all with a large pinch of salt, because almost certainly they are making things sound worse than they really are so they can get your sympathy."}, {"text": "You need to change the way you look at the world and you need to do it in a positive way. Make a point of believing that everything that happens is part of a greater cosmic plan \u2013 which means that even so-called negative events ultimately have positive outcomes."}, {"text": "Get to know what those around you are thinking today. How do you do that? You ask them. The more you are aware of what others expect from you the more likely it is you will be able to deliver, and the happier your relationships will be."}, {"text": "Anyone who tries to tell you that you should be working harder must be treated with the contempt they deserve. No one puts in more effort than you, and if partners and colleagues really can\u2019t see that then they need their eyes fixed."}, {"text": "You should be able to express yourself easily today, but as your ruling planet Mercury is moving retrograde you must make sure that the facts and figures you use are genuine. Resist the urge to make things up, because you WILL be found out."}, {"text": "You may be unhappy with the attitude of some of the people you have been dealing with but don\u2019t let it show. Act as if you are on top of each and every situation and, hopefully, they will be inspired by your positive approach and be positive too."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t lack for ideas at the moment and with Uranus, planet of genius, strong in your chart this weekend you will no doubt come up with something positively outrageous. Don\u2019t make it so outrageous though that others can\u2019t understand it."}, {"text": "What you learn over the next 48 hours will help you make sense of something that has been confusing you for weeks, if not months. Once you are aware of what\u2019s going on you will realize that your worries were entirely misplaced. It\u2019s all good Virgo."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication, will help you to think clearly this weekend, and also to speak up when you have something important to say. But don\u2019t just natter away for the sake of it. Too much talk could have unexpected and negative consequences."}, {"text": "You need to be honest and accept that you have been worrying yourself silly for no good reason, even while denying that anything is wrong. Use your razor-sharp mind to look beyond surface appearances and find out what has really been going on."}, {"text": "Both at home and at work you are finding it hard to trust people, but if you stop and think about it you will realize there is no reason why you should be so suspicious. Most people are just like you, and they certainly don\u2019t want to hurt you."}, {"text": "You know what you want and you have every intention of getting it, but to be sure of success you must be confident that the facts on which you base your aims and actions can be trusted 100 per cent. If not, give it more thought before you proceed."}, {"text": "The goal you are working your way toward may seem a long way off but don\u2019t give up on it. Your birthday chart promises that by this time next year it will be within reach, so keep at it and keep believing that each and every day matters."}, {"text": "It might by a smart idea to keep a lower than usual profile today. The moon\u2019s eclipse of Saturn suggests that someone in a position of power has got it in for you, so stay out of their way as much as you possibly can."}, {"text": "If you make a move without asking a loved one\u2019s advice first you may never hear the last of it \u2013 especially if it doesn\u2019t go as well as you had hoped. Be smart and consult your nearest and dearest before you do anything questionable."}, {"text": "Friends may be encouraging you to join them in some sort of social event but only do so if you feel up to it. The planets warn that you need plenty of rest and relaxation now, and you\u2019re unlikely to get it if you are on the move."}, {"text": "Stay calm and stay in control. That may not be an easy thing to do if someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time today but according to the planets they want you to get annoyed. Don\u2019t give them the satisfaction of falling for it."}, {"text": "Someone may tell you today that you have no right to occupy a certain position but as far as you are concerned you are the one in command and that\u2019s all that matters. Challenges to your authority must be met head on and defeated."}, {"text": "Try not to take anything you see and hear at face value today. Also, the more certain people try to steer you in a direction that does not feel right to you the more you must resist. Only you can decide where the truth is to be found."}, {"text": "You need help \u2013 that much is clear \u2013 but seem unable or unwilling to accept it, even from those who have helped you in the past. There may be a very good reason why you are suspicious but don\u2019t let it get out of hand."}, {"text": "Follow your instincts today, even if it means doing the opposite of what everyone else seems to be doing. You should know by now that your own mind is a far better guide to what you should be doing than what other people tell you."}, {"text": "Stick with what you know and trust and don\u2019t be tempted to do things in ways that don\u2019t come easily to you. If, however, you really must try something new make sure you get advice from those who have been there and done it before you."}, {"text": "You may find it difficult getting through to someone you live or work with today but that\u2019s okay. In fact, you should take the hint and stop trying altogether. Chances are they simply don\u2019t want to hear what you have to say. It\u2019s their choice!"}, {"text": "If your sixth sense tells you that someone is not being honest with you today then be on your guard. Having said which, the planets indicate this may be that one time in a hundred when your instincts are not up to scratch."}, {"text": "Keep telling yourself that as one door closes so another door opens. You may be disappointed that something you had high hopes for is coming to an end but there will be other opportunities. Remember, life is a journey, not a destination."}, {"text": "Instead of starting something new this year try dusting off a project you began, and then abandoned, way back and see if you can make it work this time. It may surprise you to find, with the extra experience you now have, how easily it comes to you."}, {"text": "If you limit yourself to one way of doing a job this weekend you will quickly get bored, so keep yourself interested by varying your routine and trying new methods. They say a change is as good as a rest, so why not put it to the test?"}, {"text": "You won\u2019t find it hard to knuckle down and get things done over the next 48 hours, but once you have got them done you must forget about work and do something more enjoyable, something that involves people who never fail to make you laugh."}, {"text": "If you spend all your time working this weekend you may give loved ones and people who value your company the impression that you don\u2019t want to see them. You must find time to have fun on a one-to-one and social level."}, {"text": "No one expects you to be perfect, so why expect it of yourself? The lesson of the stars this weekend is that you need to let go of the unreasonable expectations you have for yourself. Be who you are, not who you think you should be."}, {"text": "If you want someone to do you a favour then you will need to flatter them shamelessly. Fortunately, that is something you are good at, so lay it on thick and get whatever it is you desire in return. It\u2019s a perfectly fair exchange."}, {"text": "You may have to shut yourself away and be unsociable for a while this weekend but you really do need to concentrate and finish what you have started. There will be time for celebrations later \u2013 now you must knuckle down and get it done."}, {"text": "Try not to get caught up in the mechanics of making money. Yes, of course, those bits of green paper with numbers on them can be very handy to have but there are many more important things in life. The people you love for a start."}, {"text": "It may be the case that a friend or work colleague is holding out on you but is it important? There is precious little they can do or say to harm you \u2013 and that\u2019s not their intention anyway \u2013 so don\u2019t make a big issue of it."}, {"text": "Someone with a lot more experience than you will offer to show you how to do something this weekend and if you are smart you will watch, listen and learn. It won\u2019t be long before you are passing this knowledge on to other people."}, {"text": "It\u2019s no big deal if you fall behind in your schedule over the next 48 hours, so don\u2019t strive too hard to stay on top of what you should be doing. Most likely you have set yourself targets that are unnecessarily tough \u2013 it\u2019s something you do too often."}, {"text": "You may want to let your heart to rule your head but you know if you do you will lose out financially. Where business and money matters are concerned personal feelings must not be allowed to come into it. It\u2019s all about the bottom line."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t make any hard or fast plans for the weekend because almost certainly you will have to change them at some stage. If a friend or family member suggests you go off in a radically new direction you should agree with them. It\u2019s time for a new adventure."}, {"text": "A Venus-Saturn link on your birthday means you must take care when dealing with people in positions of authority. Do what you can to stay on their good side, but don\u2019t be afraid to speak up if you think they are taking liberties. They will respect that."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t sit there wondering where the good times are going to come from \u2013 get out into the world and make things happen. Life will be as enjoyable as you choose to make it over the next few weeks, so do whatever it takes to banish the blues."}, {"text": "You could get a bit emotional over the next 24 hours, and that\u2019s probably no bad thing as you have a tendency to keep your feelings trapped inside. Make friends with people who are not afraid to express themselves in ways you might find embarrassing."}, {"text": "If someone needs a shoulder to cry on you will be there for them with no questions asked. You know what it\u2019s like to face life on your own, so you will go out of your way to be a friend. It\u2019s one of the things you are good at."}, {"text": "You seem to be in an amazingly good mood at the moment, and long may it continue. The sun in your fellow water sign of Pisces will encourage you to be more adventurous, so much so that some people might start wondering what kind of medication you are on!"}, {"text": "Life has been hectic of late and there may be times over the next few days when you want to call a halt so you can catch your breath. But don\u2019t slow down, not yet. Now you have some momentum going you must find creative ways to use it."}, {"text": "You must let family members and other relatives know how much they mean to you. Don\u2019t just assume that because everything seems to be ticking along nicely that you don\u2019t need to remind them occasionally of your love and respect. Do it right now."}, {"text": "You expect so much of yourself but sometimes your efforts fall short, and that appears to be the situation you are in at the moment. It might pay you to lower your sights a little over the next few days. It\u2019s time to get real about your aims."}, {"text": "It would appear that someone you have always been loyal to has let you down in some way and no doubt you feel betrayed. The important thing is that you don\u2019t let your negative feelings about the situation grow worse. Confront them about it and then move on."}, {"text": "You need to get the attention of people who can assist you in reaching your goals. Both in your personal life and at work it should be obvious that you can\u2019t do it all on your own, so speak up immediately. You can never have too many allies."}, {"text": "Start looking ahead and planning some fun things for later in the year. You can, of course, do fun things now but it may be the case that personal responsibilities and lack of cash are holding you back. Your imagination though has no such restrictions."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in your next-door-neighbour sign of Capricorn is making it hard for you to see what\u2019s going on from an unbiased position. Before deciding who is right and who is wrong, get some input from family and friends. They may see things better than you."}, {"text": "By all means let partners and loved ones know how you feel today, but don\u2019t expect too much honesty in return. Not everyone is as open as you are about their emotions, so make allowances and don\u2019t get upset if they sometimes fail to respond."}, {"text": "If you break one rule over the coming 12 months you will break a dozen or more. Your birthday chart suggests you are in the mood to push the boundaries of what other people say is permitted. Just make sure that what you do is always legal."}, {"text": "You may not be the kind to worry but it seems you are beginning to panic about something of a personal nature, which is making it hard for you to tell fact from fiction. Is there any real reason to be scared? No, it\u2019s all in your mind."}, {"text": "Try not to be too aggressive when dealing with people on a one-to-one level today. Some of the things they do may annoy you but the planets suggest they will annoy you less if you lighten up a bit yourself. There is no need to get angry."}, {"text": "Whatever has been holding you back will loosen its grip today and you will start to make progress again. The only danger is that your previous failures may colour your judgement and make you less inclined to take risks. Be ambitious and be adventurous too."}, {"text": "The sun in Pisces at this time of year encourages you to expand your horizons and to look further afield for the answers you seek. If the meaning of life is something you wonder about this would be a good time to start looking for deeper answers."}, {"text": "You need to adapt to changing circumstances, not fight against them. Not even a Leo can turn back the tide of progress, so go with the flow and be in absolutely no doubt that where you end up will be better than where you are now."}, {"text": "A friend or family member will save you from yourself today. The only danger is that you may turn down their offer of assistance because you think it makes you look weak. Maybe it does but no one expects you to be strong all the time."}, {"text": "You need to be more aware of the way other people see you over the next two or three days. If they get the impression that you are just going through the motions on something you are working on together you could miss out on some big rewards."}, {"text": "Your confidence is sky high at the moment and that\u2019s good, but if you are planning to take a chance on something you must do so today, because come this time tomorrow the cosmic picture will have begun to change. Act quickly."}, {"text": "The important thing today is that you stay calm and don\u2019t let anyone upset you. Some people may be difficult to deal with but you won\u2019t solve anything by coming down to their level. Spend your time and energy on more productive pursuits."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not true that you are overly cautious, but it is true that you prefer to check and double check before making a move, and that\u2019s good. Bear that in mind today if someone tries to push you to act faster. Move at your own pace."}, {"text": "If you need to make a decision about money then do so today while you are still thinking straight. When mind planet Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow the odds will be against you again, so gamble now or don\u2019t gamble at all."}, {"text": "It is important that you don\u2019t take too much for granted today because the planets warn there are things going on behind the scenes that could trip you up if you are careless. It\u2019s okay to have fun but you must be sensible, too."}, {"text": "Try not to be quite so serious about what you do in your life. So many things that look important now may turn out later to be of no real significance at all. Also, recognize that it\u2019s relationships that matter, not what you achieve in the material world."}, {"text": "You desperately need to rest and recharge your physical, mental and emotional batteries. Also, as Mercury, planet of the mind, starts its retrograde phase today, you are advised not to begin anything new. What a great excuse for doing nothing!"}, {"text": "Question everything you are told today, even if those doing the telling are people you trust. According to the planets it is more than likely that they have got the wrong end of the stick. Check everything you hear \u2013 then check again to be sure."}, {"text": "You must be realistic about your ambitions. The planets indicate that you will taste success, but you will taste it sooner and the taste will be sweeter if you keep your feet on the ground. There is no point aiming for things you cannot reach."}, {"text": "The only thing that can hold you back today is if you let negative thoughts get the upper hand. Stop worrying about what might go wrong in your life and start thinking about all the wonderful things that could still go right \u2013 and believe that they will."}, {"text": "You seem to believe that people you live or work with have been talking behind your back, and maybe they have. However, as mind planet Mercury begins its retrograde phase today there is a very good chance that you are imagining things."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t think too much of it if you find it hard to get your point across to others today. With your ruling planet Mercury turning retrograde in your opposite sign you just have to accept that communications will be more difficult than usual."}, {"text": "Work only at the pace you feel comfortable with, because if you push yourself too hard you could run out of steam and end up a long way short of where you hoped you would be. Everyone has limits \u2013 yes, even a Libra \u2013 so be sensible about your ambitions."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need to make excuses for your failures. And you don\u2019t need to try again at things you got wrong in the past. Forget about everything you did or did not do before today and focus only on the future \u2013 it\u2019s brighter than you think."}, {"text": "Someone you have dealings with will be rather irritable today, so watch what you say or you could find yourself arguing over the most trivial of things. If possible, put some distance between you \u2013 you don\u2019t want to risk their bad mood rubbing off on you!"}, {"text": "Make sure you know all the facts before offering an opinion on an issue of the day that tends to polarize people. It might even be best to pretend that you have no strong preferences one way or the other, at least for the next three or four days."}, {"text": "You need to slow your life down a bit today, because if you rush things you could make the kind of mistake that is hard to put right. Hold back for a while and let others take the lead \u2013 so you can learn from their mistakes."}, {"text": "Make sure you have a clear idea of what it is you are trying to achieve, because if your mind is confused you could find yourself going round in circles. Don\u2019t rush yourself though \u2013 it may take several weeks before you know for sure what you should be doing."}, {"text": "You have come a long way over the past year or so and with a new moon on your birthday you will go even further over the coming 12 months. There is absolutely nothing you cannot do with your life \u2013 but it will pay you to be selective."}, {"text": "What\u2019s done is done and cannot be undone, so stop the regrets and the feeling sorry for yourself and get on with your life. Today\u2019s new moon means you must come to terms with the past \u2013 then put it behind you once and for all."}, {"text": "You will say or do something controversial today and it is sure to annoy some people who think you have no right to speak or act that way. You have every right. In fact it\u2019s your duty. The world needs people who are not afraid to be different."}, {"text": "By all means stand up for what you believe, but don\u2019t go to extremes and antagonize people just to prove how tough you can be. Give respect where respect is due and you\u2019ll get plenty of respect in return. That\u2019s the way the world works."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks you lack a sense of adventure won\u2019t think it much longer. What you do today may mark you out as a bit of a maverick but better that than being someone who always blindly follows the rules. You\u2019ll find you are appreciated more, too."}, {"text": "You need to get to grips with your financial situation. To start with that means getting tough with yourself, in the sense that you have been much too wasteful of late. Then get tough with those who have been encouraging you. You no longer need them."}, {"text": "You will draw closer to someone today and the benefits will be worth all that has happened over the past few weeks. You have endured a lot together and now you will enjoy life together. Partnerships of all kinds will go well for you now."}, {"text": "If you are having troubling getting motivated on the work front take it as a sign that maybe you should be working on something else. If you can\u2019t find the energy to get things done, just take it easy for a bit. Why exhaust yourself when you don\u2019t have to?"}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s new moon falls in the most dynamic area of your chart you should have the courage and confidence to start something special. Today is the first day of the rest of your life, so make it a good day \u2013 and a good life."}, {"text": "It does not matter how many mistakes you have made or how many times you have failed, if you start something new today it is sure to succeed. You will also be amazed how easily problems become non-problems over the next few days."}, {"text": "Get out into the world and meet new people and visit new places. Don\u2019t worry about work and money and family issues \u2013 they will take care of themselves in the fullness of time \u2013 your one and only aim now must be to have fun. You can do that!"}, {"text": "You need to stop comparing yourself to other people. Life is not a contest where the winner takes it all, and those who think that way are simply wrong.

A new moon in your sign means you have first choice of all the good things that are available. You can\u2019t have it all, but you can have the best!"}, {"text": "A sun-Neptune union on your birthday suggests that feelings of a religious or spiritual nature will come to the fore over the next 12 months. And if you are an avowed atheist? Let your interest in humanitarian matters guide you. You will make a difference."}, {"text": "If you find your way blocked today just use your imagination and find another way around. There is no set path for the journey you are on:Aall roads lead in generally the right direction \u2013 it is just a matter of making constant adjustments."}, {"text": "You seem to believe that you are not getting the respect you deserve. It isn\u2019t true, most people think highly of you, but that won\u2019t stop you doing something today that is designed to draw attention to yourself. Make sure it\u2019s for the right reasons."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let anyone take decisions for you today because the planets warn it could lead to trouble of one kind or another. Someone in a position of power and authority is watching you closely, so do whatever it takes to impress them."}, {"text": "It will pay you to be a bit more friendly today, especially if you have been tough on someone who let you down in some way. There is no point harboring a grudge, especially as you have to work together, so get over it and move on."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Neptune link could make you a bit too easygoing about your money situation. You may not care how much you spend on this and that now but you will care later on when the bills come due and you struggle to pay them."}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you make an effort to understand people. Partnerships in general are under excellent stars but there will be times when you struggle to communicate. Remember, it\u2019s not just about words, it\u2019s about body language too."}, {"text": "You are in one of those moods when you will happily do just about anything for just about anyone. Friends and even strangers will appreciate your kindness but watch out because the planets warn one particular individual may try to take advantage of you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let anyone limit your actions today. Whatever your aims and ambitions in life may be they are perfectly legitimate, even if certain people say they are not. Anyone who tries to hold you back should be kept at arm\u2019s length until they see sense."}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to adopt a low profile and you are not about to start now. Put yourself about today and make sure the world knows who you are and what you can do. Like-minded people will seek you out for good times together."}, {"text": "This could be and should be a lucky time for you, especially if you are on the move. The more you get out into the world the more likely it is you will see or hear something that can be turned to your financial or emotional advantage."}, {"text": "You are in such a generous mood at the moment that you need to be careful. Neptune\u2019s influence in the financial area of your chart means you will be thinking about money matters with your heart rather than your head \u2013 and that could cost you."}, {"text": "Try not to judge people whose values may be very different to your own. Everyone has their own destiny to follow and to expect others to be like you is just as unreasonable as if they expected you to be like them. It takes all sorts."}, {"text": "The more people try to tell you that your ambitions are unrealistic the more certain you can be that they are well within reach. The only reason they have for being so negative is they fear that your success will show them up for the losers they are."}, {"text": "You will need to show some common sense where money matters are concerned today. If you spend cash as if it is going out of fashion now you may find yourself seriously short of funds later when you find something genuinely worth spending it on."}, {"text": "You will find it easy enough to get people to see things your way and do things your way. Whether your way is also the best way remains to be seen, but remember \u2013 whatever happens next you are the one who will be held responsible."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks they can sweet talk you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do obviously has no idea who they are dealing with. Play them along if you must but don\u2019t create a situation where you have to let them down hard. They won\u2019t like it."}, {"text": "This is a good day for dealing with influential people, the kind of people who you are going to want on your side when the going gets tough. Not that it will get tough today though. Most things will come easy to you over the next 24 hours."}, {"text": "You may be having second thoughts about something you started a short time ago but your fears are unfounded. It may now seem a bit of a risk but the planets indicate that it\u2019s a risk worth taking. Keep at it Leo and you won\u2019t regret it."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in your opposite sign means you want to get along with people and you want to make a good impression. And you will. Just make sure that in your desire to keep things harmonious you don\u2019t give too much away. Partnerships must be 50-50."}, {"text": "Take absolutely no notice of something weird or wonderful that a colleague tells you today, because they simply don\u2019t know what they are talking about. Most likely they don\u2019t even believe it themselves \u2013 they just enjoy a bit of meaningless gossip."}, {"text": "You may not agree with someone\u2019s opinions but you have to agree they have every right to express those opinions. If you find that what they say rubs you the wrong way just remove yourself from their presence. You are under no obligation to stick around."}, {"text": "Everyone has limits \u2013 yes, even a Sagittarius \u2013 and it will be pretty obvious when you are approaching those limits today. If you are smart you will rein yourself in and live to fight another day. If you are not so smart . . . who knows what might happen!"}, {"text": "You must not allow your personal feelings to influence any business or work-related decisions you need to make today. Whatever the rights and wrongs of a particular situation the only thing that matters now is how you can benefit materially."}, {"text": "The planets warn there is someone out there who is jealous of your popularity and is hoping to get a chance to make you look bad. That can only happen if you lower your guard. If someone starts to flatter you shamelessly today most likely it\u2019s a trick."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority is not convinced that you have what it takes to reach the targets you have set for yourself. What can you do to prove them wrong? You can start by not worrying about it. Stay loose and just be yourself."}, {"text": "A sun-Saturn link on your birthday is good for friendships and also for partnerships that bring like-minded people together. If you can get together a group of people who share the same outlook on life you might even find ways to change the world."}, {"text": "The best way to get what you want this weekend is to pull a few strings from behind the scenes. If you approach tense situations head-on you will more than likely make matters worse, so make it look as if you don\u2019t really care what happens."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let it worry you if you get cross with someone you usually get along with quite well today. Even the best of friends fall out now and again and on this occasion it will help clear the air. You\u2019ll be buddies again tomorrow."}, {"text": "If you get the chance to enter a contest or a competition of some kind this weekend you must seize it with both hands. Today\u2019s sun-Saturn link will give you the kind of drive and determination you sometimes lack. In short, you can\u2019t lose."}, {"text": "Don't worry too much if you are a bit short of cash at the moment because the things you need will come to you anyway. Cancer is one of the more resourceful signs of the zodiac and you\u2019ll find ways to satisfy your needs one way or another."}, {"text": "If someone says something to you today that seems designed to make you angry your best course of action by far is to ignore it. Almost certainly they are trying to goad you into the kind of reaction that makes them look good by making you look bad."}, {"text": "Someone you have dealings with on a daily basis is getting a bit too assertive for your tastes and at some stage you will need to remind them that this is supposed to be a partnership of equals. Let them know you are not afraid to walk away."}, {"text": "You will have to do something this weekend that you really don\u2019t want to do, but being the kind of person who does not like letting other people down you will hold your nose and do it anyway. You might be surprised to find you actually enjoy it."}, {"text": "People you deal with on a one-to-one basis will give you whatever it is you desire today, because they know you won\u2019t take no for an answer. Try not to be too imperious though. Co-operation is by far a better long-term tactic than coercion."}, {"text": "You may find it hard keeping certain feelings to yourself today, even though you know you should. If you do open up and criticize someone try not to be too negative about it. They will respond better to encouragement than they will to criticism."}, {"text": "Travel and social activities are under very good stars at the moment, so get out into the world and have some fun. Don\u2019t worry that you might stray in the wrong direction, because even if you do the cosmic powers that be will guide you back safely."}, {"text": "The message of the stars now is that you should not push yourself too hard, not at home, not at work and not even in your social life. Next week is going to be rather busy, so save your energy over the next 48 hours. Breathe deep and relax."}, {"text": "You must refuse to accept second best this weekend. In every situation you find yourself in you must aim to be at the front where people can see you. The time for hanging back and hiding is over \u2013 get out there and put on a show!"}, {"text": "Listen carefully to what your inner voice is trying to tell you and, once the message has got through, follow it to its logical conclusion. Intuition and intellect are not separate things and if you can get them working together this year no goal will be beyond you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t blame yourself if you have failed to reach some of the targets you have set yourself in recent weeks. The fact that Mercury has been moving retrograde of late has made it much harder to make plans. As from today though your mind will be razor sharp."}, {"text": "A decision needs to be made about your career, and now that mind planet Mercury is about to move in your favuor again you won\u2019t let minor issues or petty people hold you back from doing what you know is right. As from today, it\u2019s full speed ahead."}, {"text": "All sorts of weird and wonderful ideas have been going through your head of late and, of course, very few of them will come to much. However, one particular idea seems to have taken root and keeps nagging at you to do something with it. So get doing!"}, {"text": "Something you thought was of vital importance a week or two back now does not interest you in the slightest, and that\u2019s good. According to the planets you allowed other people to influence your thinking instead of listening first and foremost to your inner voice."}, {"text": "Make sure everyone knows how you feel. Don\u2019t just assume they can see you are hurting, spell it out for them in words of three syllables or less. Because you look so confident others may think you have got everything under control, but that\u2019s far from the truth."}, {"text": "Avoid trivial issues and trivial people over the next 24 hours. You have some major matters to deal with and the very last thing you need is to be distracted, so build a kind of exclusion zone around you where you control who and what comes in."}, {"text": "Your confidence may have taken one or two knocks in recent weeks but now that mind planet Mercury is ending its retrograde phase you will soon realize that what has been getting you down is of no consequence at all. Life is looking good again!"}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks they can lead you astray is going to end up looking rather foolish. Even on the worst of days Scorpio is a sign that is difficult to fool, and today you are very much on the ball, which you will bounce right back in their face!"}, {"text": "The more others try to predict what you will say or do next the more you will enjoy surprising them. It is a part of your nature to be original, and sometimes outrageous, and that part will come to the fore in a big way over the next few days."}, {"text": "Are the fun times coming to an end? Not if you have anything to say about it. The main trick in getting the most out of life is to do what you enjoy most, so put a smile on your face and create things that make other people smile as well."}, {"text": "You may have found it hard to express yourself of late, but now that communications planet Mercury is moving in your favor again the words will flow from you as if a dam has burst. Make sure they are good words. Build people up, don\u2019t knock them down."}, {"text": "You may not have much time to yourself at the moment but you can, if you try, find time to think about some of life\u2019s bigger questions. Find a quiet place where you won\u2019t be disturbed and let your thoughts expand out into the universe."}, {"text": "Even if you are the kind of Pisces who never strays far from home the coming 12 months will see you heading off in all sorts of directions, and loving every minute of it. What you see and hear on your travels will transform your existence."}, {"text": "Someone you can usually rely on will say or do something today that makes you realize you may have been wrong to place your trust in them. But don\u2019t put all the blame on them \u2013 it\u2019s just as much your fault for overlooking their flaws."}, {"text": "You may think that your current idea is the best thing since, well, since your last big idea, but is it really that good or are you deceiving yourself? The planets indicate it may be the latter, so don\u2019t commit time and money to it just yet."}, {"text": "You may feel confident and you may feel courageous but that is not a good enough reason to take on someone in a position of power. If you feel the need to prove yourself wait a week or so until the sun moves in your favour again."}, {"text": "Visualize where you would like to be a few months from now then start doing the small, everyday things that will move you closer to that goal. It\u2019s all very well having a far-reaching plan but it\u2019s what you do on a daily basis that makes it happen."}, {"text": "Something you have laboured long and hard to resolve, with no success, will sort itself out over the next two or three days. It may annoy you that you were unable to crack it yourself but don\u2019t get too upset \u2013 even a Leo has some limitations."}, {"text": "Someone you have clashed with in the past will be unusually friendly toward you today and, of course, it will make you suspicious. It could well be that they are up to no good but can you be sure? Be nice in return but don\u2019t let down your guard."}, {"text": "You are bursting with energy and will find constructive ways to release it. But while you may be in the mood to give 100 per cent don\u2019t expect everyone around you to be on the same level. Very few will be able to keep up with you today."}, {"text": "Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours because if you hurt a friend\u2019s or work colleague\u2019s feelings it could rebound on you. Remember, a remark that sounds funny to you could sound insulting to someone else, so think before you speak."}, {"text": "Don't worry that you have fallen behind in your schedule, because with Mars in the work area of your chart you will catch up easily enough when you feel the moment is right. Today though, focus on relationships. Love, not work, makes the world go around."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your time arguing with people whose opinions you find ridiculous, just let them get on with their lives while you get on with your own. Nothing they say will ever change what you believe, so pretend they, and their opinions, do not exist."}, {"text": "If you have faith in your abilities then there is precious little you cannot accomplish. Yes, of course, you have doubts and fears like everyone else, but if you make an effort to shut them out of your mind today they won\u2019t do you much damage."}, {"text": "Pisces is a water sign and emotional by nature, which has its good side but also its bad, and the planets warn you must not allow yourself to get emotional about issues you cannot change or people you cannot control. Look on the bright side every day."}, {"text": "There will be times over the year ahead when you wish those around you were a little more open in the way they think and communicate, but you have to accept that not everyone can be like you. Do wonderful things \u2013 so they can learn from your example."}, {"text": "Not everyone will approve of what you do over the next few days, but why should that worry you? Don\u2019t make things difficult for yourself by trying to tailor your actions to suit other people \u2013 that will just encourage them to oppose you even more."}, {"text": "Travel arrangements are likely to go awry over the next 24 hours, so give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination. If possible, keep your journeys short. If that isn\u2019t possible, make sure you have your route sorted out well in advance."}, {"text": "A financial loss of some sort may seem a big deal to you now but it won\u2019t be long before you realize it is really quite trivial and not worth getting worked up about. The one thing you must not do is fall out with a friend over money."}, {"text": "Someone who thinks the world of you will make you happy today, simply by telling you what a special person you are to them. Make sure they know how much you appreciate them as well. When was the last time you let your feelings show?"}, {"text": "Take note of the little things that happen today because it\u2019s likely the universe is trying to tell you something and the messages it sends may not be obvious. You need to be subtle, not just in the way you think but in the way you act as well."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t leave partners and colleagues guessing what it is you expect of them. This is one of those days when you need to spell things out for them in words of three syllables or less. Neither you nor they can afford any major misunderstandings."}, {"text": "Someone is getting on your nerves with their constant complaining and at some point today you must let them know, forcefully, that you\u2019ve had enough. You can be a bit sharp-tongued when the mod takes you, and it will most likely take you today."}, {"text": "Okay, so you have almost zero enthusiasm for what you are expected to do, but you know you have to do it anyway, so make a good job of it. Try pretending that it is the most amazing thing you have ever done \u2013 it will make it much easier."}, {"text": "You are in no mood to waste time on fools and anyone who tries to get you interested in trivial matters must be told in no uncertain terms to get lost. Do you really need to be that brutal? Sadly, on this occasion, it\u2019s the only way."}, {"text": "If someone you respect says something that hurts you today don\u2019t automatically assume they have turned against you. It may just be that they don\u2019t realize how sensitive you are about certain issues. Maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s you who needs to toughen up a bit."}, {"text": "Do not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 even think about cutting corners or taking the easy way out over the next 24 hours. If you have been entrusted with a task of some kind it is because others know you will give it 100 per cent. Don\u2019t disappoint them."}, {"text": "Some people will say that you are dreaming your life away, and they may even be right, but don\u2019t stop. You are at your best when you give your imagination its head, so by all means let your mind go where it pleases \u2013 and something very pleasing will occur."}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link on your birthday urges you to do something with your ideas and ideals. What is the one thing that inspires you more than anything else? What is the one thing you dream most of doing for the rest of your days? So do it \u2013 now!"}, {"text": "You will get an opportunity to improve either your career or your financial position today \u2013 if you are especially lucky it may even be both. It seems the powers that be have recognized your worth and are about to reward you for it. About time too!"}, {"text": "If you let your imagination lead you in directions that don\u2019t feel right for you this could be a difficult day. Stick with what you know and aim to do what you have done many times before, only better than ever. You don\u2019t need to start something new."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that you will swing between extremes in the way you look at the world today. Nothing bad will come of it so long as you keep your thoughts to yourself. The more radical your ideas the more you need to keep them to yourself!"}, {"text": "You will want to help a friend or family member today but make sure they actually welcome your assistance before you go changing stuff for them. It\u2019s quite possible that they are happy to wallow in their own gloom, at least for the time being."}, {"text": "What looks like a failure to you may seem like a success to someone else, so don\u2019t be too eager to tell them where and why they are doing it wrong. Not everyone has the same sort of standards as you, so there is no point being too judgmental."}, {"text": "The whole world could be against you now and you would not care in the slightest. With the sun and Pluto on excellent terms you possess the mental power to see through the surface of things to the deeper reality \u2013 and the deeper reality says everything is wonderful!"}, {"text": "You will get more than one opportunity to improve your work situation over the next few days and all you need to do is get it right once and your worries will soon be over. Show willing and show the world you\u2019ve got what it takes."}, {"text": "Pluto, your ruler, is linked to the sun today, making it easy for you to turn ideas into realities, both in your personal affairs and in your work. Give yourself a break occasionally though \u2013 a walk in the fresh air will do wonders for your spirit."}, {"text": "This is potentially a very good day for money matters as wealth planet Pluto reveals the kind of opportunities that stay hidden from most people. But you\u2019re not most people, you\u2019re special, so get on and make something of what the universe shows you."}, {"text": "Sometimes in life you have to do things that other people don\u2019t want you to do. Sometimes in life you have to act on what your inner voice tells you. Today\u2019s sun-Pluto link will give you the courage to be radical, even ruthless, in pursuit of your ambitions."}, {"text": "You seem to be in two minds which direction to move in at the moment. In which case your best course of action by far is to stay right where you are. You don\u2019t have to be on the go every minute of every day. Activity is overrated."}, {"text": "By all means get together with people who share your dreams and ambitions but don\u2019t try to impose your will on them. You have so much in common that there should be no need for one to lead and the rest to follow. You\u2019re all leaders \u2013 and winners."}, {"text": "You have a choice this year: Either you throw caution to the wind and, more likely than not, end up disappointed that your efforts fall short; or you take it a step at a time and build up slowly towards your ultimate aim. Be sensible and do it right."}, {"text": "If you find yourself in a heated discussion with a friend or work colleague over something that is really quite trivial then take a step back and resolve to just let it go. Why get yourself worked up about something that isn\u2019t worth the effort?"}, {"text": "By all means start planning your next big move but don\u2019t commit yourself fully just yet. Today\u2019s sun-Jupiter link warns you may be setting targets for yourself that are way too high, which will inevitably lead to disappointment. Know your limits and stay within them."}, {"text": "If you find yourself arguing with someone over a political or social issue today don\u2019t back down but don\u2019t take it too far and risk falling out with them completely. Find a way to change the subject so you can start moving away from what divides you."}, {"text": "The news you receive today will be neither good nor bad in itself, but how you choose to interpret it will define it as one of those things in your own mind. In which case you should strive to look on the positive side. Why make yourself unhappy?"}, {"text": "This is a good day to get together with loved ones and talk through issues that concern you all. Any problems you\u2019ve had in the past can quite easily be resolved now, just so long as you accept there is no \u201cright\u201d way or \u201cwrong\u201d way to do things."}, {"text": "Your workload has got a bit too much of late and you need to get a grip and get back on top of it. That means you will need to tell certain people that you can no longer do some things for them. Say it and mean it."}, {"text": "You will need to take some important decisions today and the most important one of all is whether to devote yourself to work or play. You know there is a lot to do and you don\u2019t want to fall any further behind \u2013 so get on with it!"}, {"text": "Whatever else you choose to do over the next 24 hours you must \u2013 repeat, must \u2013 keep your cash in your pocket. If you start spending money, even on small things, you may find it hard to stop. There\u2019s nothing you need that you have not already got."}, {"text": "Even if you are one of those rare Sagittarians who prefer to keep their opinions to themselves you won\u2019t hesitate to speak up today \u2013 and you must speak loud too to make sure everyone hears what you have to say. It\u2019s too important to keep to yourself."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the communications area of your chart gives you the confidence to put across your point of view, but make sure you can back up your claims with facts. If you pluck opinions out of the air someone who knows their stuff could make you look silly."}, {"text": "Try not to focus too much on details today. It\u2019s the bigger picture that matters and someone with your breadth of vision should be looking for ways to make life more satisfying, not just for yourself, but for those who rely on you too."}, {"text": "The sun in your sign does wonders for your confidence but with Jupiter getting in on the act as well you must be careful you don\u2019t go too far and act in ways that invite a backlash from the universe \u2013 not to mention the people you work with!"}, {"text": "The one and only thing you need to remember over the coming year is that your mind creates your world \u2013 always. If you keep that thought front and centre, and act accordingly, you will create the kind of life so many dream of, yet so few attain."}, {"text": "Make forgive and forget your motto, even if it is only for a day or two. It isn\u2019t worth your precious time and energy carrying on some kind of feud, so pretend it never happened and that you are the best of friends rather than the worst of enemies."}, {"text": "You may be a touch ruthless today, especially where one-to-one relationships are concerned. Yes, of course, you need to protect your interests but don\u2019t be too hard-hearted or you could drive away someone who should be one of your closest friends."}, {"text": "Be careful what you spend your money on today and over the weekend because someone out there has you marked down as gullible and may seek to take advantage. Just because you would not try to cheat them does not mean they won\u2019t try to cheat you."}, {"text": "Give people you live, work and socialize with your support today, even if they do things that to your mind are stupid in the extreme. If they make an error of some sort just pretend you have not noticed and give them a chance to put it right."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t lack for common sense but for some reason you will act in an illogical manner today. Nothing bad will come of it though, so do what feels right in the moment and don\u2019t worry if it doesn\u2019t work out quite the way you had hoped."}, {"text": "By all means be helpful today but don\u2019t go any further than that. If you start doing things for other people that they should be doing for themselves there will be no end to it, so point them in the right direction but let them do the marching!"}, {"text": "Does the ends sometimes justify the means? Not if the means are negative or nasty. Ultimately, life is about the journey, not the destination, so the way you achieve things today is going to mean more than the extent of your material success."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to strive to get what you want. In fact you don\u2019t have to strive at all. Find a comfortable place to watch the world go by and at some stage today what comes before you will be precisely the thing you most desire."}, {"text": "It\u2019s unlikely that your secrets will stay secret for long. With communications planet Mercury at odds with your ruler Jupiter today you are sure to let slip facts and figures you really should keep to yourself. Why? Because you can\u2019t resist showing off!"}, {"text": "Let that special someone know how you feel. Let them see how much they mean to you and that you will always be there for them. You may not be the most romantic of signs but you have your moments, and this will be one of them!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be embarrassed to use people in positions of authority to get what you desire today. If you need a favour from someone higher up the professional ladder than you then now is the time to ask them. It\u2019s highly unlikely they will refuse."}, {"text": "It\u2019s okay to be honest about your feelings, but you need to be tactful as well. Just remember that while Mercury is undergoing its current retrograde phase what you say may come back to haunt you at some time in the future \u2013 so be careful."}, {"text": "A Mercury-Pluto link on your birthday suggests you will be attracted to questions and answers that go deeper than what most people might regard as \u201creality\u201d. Just be careful you don\u2019t get too close to people whose views are, to say the least, a bit extreme."}, {"text": "Take what a friend tells you this weekend very seriously indeed. It may seem as if they are being unduly melodramatic but the planets warn they know things that you do not. Listen to their concerns \u2013 because they are your concerns too."}, {"text": "There are a lot of wild ideas flying about at the moment and there is a danger you could get caught up in the hysteria and start believing some of the things you hear. What happened to that famous Taurus common sense? Don\u2019t lose your head this weekend."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority has been giving you a tough time of late but that\u2019s okay because you\u2019re a pretty tough cookie yourself. What they try to do over the next 48 hours won\u2019t do you any favours, so be brave and reject it."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your time and energy chasing after things you cannot have \u2013 and which probably would not be good for you if you got your hands on them. Apply your Cancer skills to something, or someone, more deserving of your attention."}, {"text": "For some reason or other you appear to mistrust someone without the faintest idea why. Is your sixth sense trying to tell you something? Or have you merely got the wrong end of the stick? What happens this weekend will answer those questions."}, {"text": "If you find yourself locked in some kind of dispute this weekend neither you nor your opponent will want to back down. Somehow you need to find a point of agreement where your minds can meet. You may have to give ground \u2013 a little."}, {"text": "If you find yourself working on something that does not interest you much don\u2019t try to wriggle your way out of it. Instead, resolve to do it to the best of your ability. It may not be much fun but it will win you some useful new friends."}, {"text": "Anyone who expects you to compromise this weekend obviously has not had much experience of dealing with Scorpios. In your vocabulary the word \u201ccompromise\u201d actually means \u201cdo it my way\u201d. Refuse to back down and you\u2019ll get what you want."}, {"text": "The current cosmic picture warns that you could easily overreact and start a fight over something that isn\u2019t that important. If it happens, then fight to win \u2013 but a better strategy might be not to fight at all. What can you do to avoid confrontation?"}, {"text": "You won\u2019t have any doubts about what you intend to do this weekend, even though everyone and their dog seems to be against you. You enjoy taking on challenges \u2013 the bigger the better \u2013 but even more than that you enjoy proving people wrong."}, {"text": "Your mind is incredibly sharp at the moment, which could be useful if you are looking to make some money because the planets suggest that a business proposition of some sort is just what your bank manager ordered. Really go for it over the next 48 hours."}, {"text": "You will have no trouble making snap decisions this weekend, but will they be good decisions? That depends on how willing you are to listen to advice from people who have more experience than you. Use what they know to enrich yourself."}, {"text": "It may seem as if you have not moved much closer to your dream over the past 12 months but that simply isn\u2019t true. Everything builds on what went before and the experiences you had then will make it easier for you to succeed now \u2013 so keep at it."}, {"text": "Success comes to those who believe they deserve it, so stop worrying that you are not up to whatever task is in front of you and just get on with it. Your mind creates your future, so make up your mind to be the best \u2013 and you will be."}, {"text": "You are strongly advised to listen to advice from someone who clearly knows more about a certain situation than you do. Then act on what they tell you. It could save you from making a big mistake, as well as looking a little bit silly."}, {"text": "You will go out of your way to prove that you are not as indecisive as some people say you are. That\u2019s fine, but you will also need to make sure that when you make a decision it\u2019s the correct one. Get the balance right between thinking and acting."}, {"text": "There are so many opportunities available to you now that you may be having trouble deciding which direction you should be moving. The message of the stars is that it really doesn\u2019t matter. Choose a goal \u2013 any goal \u2013 and stick with it to the end."}, {"text": "If you want to make the most of the opportunities that are going to be coming your way over the next few weeks then you need to know what it is you are aiming for in life. Identify your No.1 priority and organize everything else around that."}, {"text": "Just because you have your doubts about what a friend has been up to does not mean you should turn your back on them. Everyone is different and everyone can be a bit mule-headed at times \u2013 yes, even a Virgo \u2013 so give them your full support."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you have a clear picture in your mind of the kind of success you are striving for. That way, even when you wander off course occasionally \u2013 as you will \u2013 you can easily get yourself back on track again."}, {"text": "If you feel out of sorts in your present location then pack a bag and get out of there. You don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s permission to move on, and neither do you have to explain what your motives are. You may not even know them yourself."}, {"text": "If you insist on seeing the negative side in every situation then, inevitably, that is how things will work out for you. Your attitude to what you experience is far more important than the events themselves, so change your outlook and your world will change too."}, {"text": "Whatever suggestions friends and loved ones might come up with over the next few days you don\u2019t have to agree with them, and you certainly don\u2019t have to do as they say just to keep them sweet. Trust your own instincts and act on them first."}, {"text": "The cosmic picture is about to change and for you it will be a good change, so stop fretting about all those minor issues that have been taking up all your time and energy and set your sights on reaching the big time again \u2013 it\u2019s where you belong."}, {"text": "It may look as if everyone else is moving in one direction while you are moving in the opposite direction but looks can be deceiving. And anyway, whatever route you take you will all end up at the same destination eventually, so why worry?"}, {"text": "A Mars-Mercury link on your birthday means you will find your voice over the coming 12 months, which is good, but also that some of your opinions may be a little \u201cway out\u201d for other people\u2019s liking, which is not so good. Think twice before you speak up."}, {"text": "You are never afraid to work hard to get what you want but don\u2019t try to do the impossible. Make sure the aims and ambitions you set for yourself are within reach, otherwise you could exhaust yourself and have nothing to show for it."}, {"text": "Start something new over the next few days, something you have been thinking about for quite some time but did not, until now, have the courage to go for. For best results, don\u2019t try to do it on your own \u2013 get a small group of friends to help you."}, {"text": "You will have to make some kind of sacrifice today but you will make it gladly, not least because you know you will be rewarded in some way further down the line. Try to avoid conflicts on the work front \u2013 they\u2019re just not worth it."}, {"text": "If you feel out of your depth today you must let other knows about it so they can help you. It would be nice if loved ones could read your thoughts and know what you need but they can\u2019t, so you have to spell it out for them."}, {"text": "There is a chance that you will come into money over the next few days, and an even bigger chance that you will waste it if you do. Leo tends to extravagance and it seems you are in one of your spend, spend, spend moods at the moment."}, {"text": "Put your own needs first today and don\u2019t feel guilty about it. Some people may say you are being selfish, and maybe you are, but the fact is you have done so many things for so many people in the past, so they have no cause for complaint."}, {"text": "You must not let your work get on top of you today. There are a number ways you can make life easier for yourself and the best is to refuse to take on any more commitments. Practice saying the word \u201cno\u201d \u2013 then say it loud and often!"}, {"text": "Some of the people you meet over the next few days could become very important to you, professionally and financially, later in the year, so be on your best behaviour and make sure they like what they see. The more you impress them the more you will gain."}, {"text": "Look and act confident today, even if you doubt what it is you are doing. The planets warn if your rivals detect any hint of anxiety they will be on your case in an instant. You DO have what it takes to succeed Sag, so get on with it."}, {"text": "The approaching full moon will fill your head with big ideas, especially where your career is concerned, but not all of them will be right for you. Decide what your No. 1 priority is going to be and focus on it to the exclusion of everything else."}, {"text": "You will have to make some tough decisions over the next few days and some people will be annoyed by the path you choose to take. That\u2019s too bad. No one has the right to tell you what you should be doing, so ignore the disapproving looks."}, {"text": "You are, of course, entirely free to make your own decisions, but while Mercury is moving retrograde through your sign you must be 100 per cent certain that the facts and figures on which you base those decisions are correct. Double check them."}, {"text": "According to your birthday chart your talents are being wasted in your current environment, so start thinking about where you could go to improve your chances of success. Take that next big step and move on to something bigger and better."}, {"text": "Once the sun moves into your sign tomorrow you will quickly find your feet again and before you know it you will be miles ahead of everyone else. But don\u2019t do things just for the sake of it \u2013 do things because you believe in them."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart may make you a bit more fearful than usual over the next few days, but no matter. You don\u2019t have to be out there doing great things all the time. It\u2019s okay to go slow occasionally."}, {"text": "You may not be the sort to get carried away by magical thinking but the planets indicate that if you make some kind of wish today it might just come true. The universe is very much on your side at the moment, so let it work for you."}, {"text": "The sun is about to move into the area of your chart that governs your position in the world, making this the ideal time to decide what kind of life you want to be leading a year or even 10 years from now. Think big and aim high."}, {"text": "One of the best times of the year is about to begin, so banish negative thoughts from your mind and force yourself to believe that all things are possible. Some truly amazing events will occur over the next few weeks \u2013 and you will be at the centre of them."}, {"text": "Keep confidential information to yourself today, because if you let slip what friends and colleagues are up to the wrong people could find out and it will be you who gets the blame. You can be too chatty for your own good sometimes."}, {"text": "If you make an effort to be pleasant today \u2013 especially with people who actually rub you the wrong way \u2013 you will reap the benefits in the very near future. As the sun moves into your opposite sign of Aries tomorrow relationships will take on added importance."}, {"text": "Conserve your energy and pay attention to what your body is trying to tell you. Your drive and determination is such that you often push yourself way beyond your natural limits, but you cannot do that forever. Take a rest today \u2013 no one can say you don\u2019t deserve it."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s change of signs tomorrow means you are about to embark on one of the best times of the year, a time for getting things done and a time for having fun. Anyone whose negative attitude annoys you must be banished from your thoughts and feelings."}, {"text": "Honesty is not just the best policy, it\u2019s the only policy, and even if you know that what you say won\u2019t sit well with certain people you must say it anyway. Not all criticism is bad and today you have a duty to call it as you see it."}, {"text": "As the sun is about to move into the communications area of your chart you won\u2019t have much trouble putting across your point of view. But don\u2019t be too pushy about it. Yes, most likely you are right, but others are entitled to their opinions too."}, {"text": "The past few weeks have been a lot of fun and there is no reason why the next few weeks should not be fun as well. However, you do need to take a critical look at your spending habits. Better still, find ways to boost your income."}, {"text": "A Mars-Pluto link on your birthday will endow you with almost superhuman levels of energy and encourage you to believe that with the right degree of ambition and application all things are possible. Those who stand in your way won\u2019t be standing for long!"}, {"text": "A new solar year begins for you today, and with your ruling planet Mars also on excellent form the omens are good for the coming month. Don\u2019t let anything hold you back \u2013 if there is something you are keen to do then get on with it straight away."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be surprised if certain people are unreasonably critical of you over the next few days. And don\u2019t react to it either. If you show that you are a bit thin-skinned they will try all the harder to rile you. Pretend you just don\u2019t care."}, {"text": "Get out into the world and have fun with your friends. Some may say that it\u2019s wrong to be so light-hearted when there are so many things that need changing in the world but the fact is you are more likely to change them with laughter than with anger."}, {"text": "If you dream about moving up in the world, or of doing something special, now is the time to stop thinking about it and start doing the things that will bring it about. Don\u2019t be afraid to approach people in positions of power \u2013 they want to help you."}, {"text": "Restrictions that have been holding you back in recent weeks will lose their power over you as from today. The sense of freedom you feel will be amazing. Take advantage of it by going where you want, when you want, with whom you want."}, {"text": "It is important that you stick closely to the facts today, especially where anything to do with your financial health is concerned. It\u2019s not like you to get sentimental, especially about material things, but there is a real danger of that now."}, {"text": "No matter how independent-minded a Libra you may be you will want to get close to people now that the sun is moving into the partnership area of your chart. Never doubt that you are loved and never miss a chance to give back love in return."}, {"text": "It\u2019s one thing to have a head full of good ideas but quite another to take those ideas and make something of them. Over the next few weeks you should focus on one, maybe two, of them and go all out to turn great ideas into concrete realities."}, {"text": "You should be at your most outgoing and optimistic now that the sun is moving in your favour. You certainly won\u2019t waste time worrying about issues you have no way of changing or controlling. Life is about what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in one of the more emotional areas of your chart could make you a bit touchy, even more so as the moon is almost full. Whatever others might say and do try not to let it get to you. It\u2019s a mistake to take everything personally."}, {"text": "Your words have more of an effect than you sometimes realize, so watch your tongue today and tomorrow because it will be easy for others to take what you say the wrong way, and with a full moon looming they may not be inclined to forgive you."}, {"text": "As the sun moves out of your birth sign today you have to come to terms with the fact that you no longer have the same room for maneuver as you did before. There is still plenty you can do, but you can\u2019t do it all on your own."}, {"text": "A full moon on your birthday means you need to pay closer attention to what those around you, both at home and at work, expect of you. Compromise is essential \u2013 you will get nowhere if you expect your wishes to be paramount each and every time."}, {"text": "Someone will try to persuade you to do something today that you would not choose to do of your own volition. The trouble is you seem to believe that you owe them in some way. Maybe you do, but think carefully before saying yes \u2013 you could easily regret it."}, {"text": "The full moon will in some way or other tax your patience and it\u2019s quite likely that you will have words with someone before the end of the day. On the work front especially you need to make allowances for people who are not as switched on as you."}, {"text": "Someone you usually get along with may act a bit negative toward you today, but don\u2019t let it get to you and don\u2019t think it is the end of your friendship. They may be emotionally touchy today but come the weekend they will be all smiles again."}, {"text": "You may not have a care in the world at the moment but someone you are close to emotionally is going through a pretty tough time and you must do what you can to help them. Give them a cuddle and let them know that you care."}, {"text": "You are advised not to make too many changes today or tomorrow because the current full moon could trick you into moving in a direction that is not right for you. Leave things as they are, at least until the weekend. The less you do, the better."}, {"text": "Wherever you go and whatever you do today you will have a lot of fun, but you will also spend a lot of money and need to know when you have gone too far. Unlike leaves, those little pieces of green paper do NOT grow on trees!"}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s full moon takes place in your birth sign it should come as no surprise if you get a bit emotional. But it must not be allowed to stop you from pushing ahead with your plans. If you offend someone, say sorry and then forget about it."}, {"text": "Stop worrying about minor problems and start looking forward to a time when you will feel on top of the world and be in the mood to challenge your rivals in ways you have not been able to do in the past. Remember, the future starts today."}, {"text": "If you need to get back on good terms with someone you have fallen out with this would be a good day to approach them and offer to talk through your problems. Chances are they are as eager as you to leave the past behind."}, {"text": "Try not to worry too much about what\u2019s going on in your place of work at the moment. Yes, of course, it is more than a little unsettling, but the full moon indicates it is also temporary and will have no adverse effect on your job or career."}, {"text": "Travel and social plans may be high on your agenda but the full moon will in some way or other disrupt them, so be ready to change direction at a moment\u2019s notice. Stay calm and deal with what happens in a logical, rather than an emotional way."}, {"text": "Your feelings could easily lead you astray over the next 48 hours, so be aware that what drives you is not need but desire. There is nothing wrong with desire, of course, but it cannot be permitted to govern your decisions, still less your entire life."}, {"text": "If you listen to and act on what other people tell you over the coming year you will probably do okay, but you won\u2019t do anywhere near as well as you would have done if you had listened to your own inner voice. Always put your instincts first."}, {"text": "Flaunt your abilities. Let the whole wide world know what you are capable of. The sun in your sign gives you the courage and the confidence to move beyond what has limited you in the past. Today there are no limits \u2013 so shine!"}, {"text": "If there is something you are not sure of today you must get a second opinion, even if it means admitting that maybe you don\u2019t know as much as you thought you did. Most likely you are just missing a few facts and figures \u2013 nothing more."}, {"text": "A friend wants you to do one thing but a loved one wants you to do something completely different. It has to be one or the other \u2013 you cannot please them both \u2013 so make a decision and stick with it. Hopefully the consequences won\u2019t be too bad."}, {"text": "The kinder you are to people who probably do not deserve it the less likely it is that you will get any thanks. But don\u2019t let that stop you. It\u2019s not about the way they choose to react, it\u2019s about the kind of person you choose to be."}, {"text": "The message of the planets today is that you must resist the temptation to waste money on things you don\u2019t need. The more cash you keep in your pocket now the more you will have to spend on something that is genuinely worth it early next week."}, {"text": "Keep personal information to yourself today. If you reveal things about yourself that other people don\u2019t need to know you could find later on that someone who does not have your interests at heart makes use of it in a negative way."}, {"text": "No doubt you have many questions but are you ready for the answers? The planets warn if you go looking into areas that don\u2019t concern you today what you discover may not be to your liking. Stick with the easy questions \u2013 they\u2019re safer."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority wants you to do something that clearly is not in your interests. So what do you do? You let them know as politely as possible that, on this occasion, you cannot agree. Help them in other ways."}, {"text": "It may be tempting to believe that the best way to get your life moving again is to give up on everything that went before and start anew but don\u2019t be hasty. There is a lot of good stuff in your past that is worth holding on to."}, {"text": "If someone throws your offer of help back at you today don\u2019t get angry about it. Chances are they are under so much pressure at the moment that they just want to be left alone to sort things out their way. Respect that and keep your distance."}, {"text": "You may feel a sense of duty to a certain individual but you don\u2019t have to do what they ask of you without thinking about it. If their suggestion is not to your liking make it your business to point out why and how they should change their approach."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t take risks with money and certainly don\u2019t take risks with other people\u2019s money. The effects of yesterday\u2019s full moon still linger and if you\u2019re not careful you could easily make a mistake that results in the kind of loss that no one is happy with."}, {"text": "Make life easier for yourself over the coming 12 months by starting with the assumption that the world is a wonderful place and everyone in it has some good in them. The way you think as a matter of habit determines the nature of your human experience."}, {"text": "The way to deal with someone\u2019s negative emotions is to not allow yourself to get negative or emotional in return. This is your time of year, so don\u2019t let anyone spoil it. Life is good \u2013 for you \u2013 and about to get many times better."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to ignore a problem of some kind in the hope that it will go away of its own accord, but it won\u2019t, so you really have no choice but to deal with the matter. Chances are that as problems go it\u2019s actually quite minor."}, {"text": "Be careful what you say over the next 48 hours because if you are not absolutely clear about your meaning your words could be taken the wrong way by someone who won\u2019t hesitate to cause a scene. Sharpen your communication skills \u2013 you\u2019re going to need them."}, {"text": "The news you receive this weekend may seem a bit dark but nevertheless you have every reason to look on the bright side. No matter what other people might say, if you focus only on good things then only good things are likely to happen."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the most exciting times of the year for you, so get your act together and start doing the kind of things you hardly dared dream about in the past. The bigger your sense of adventure the bigger your successes will be."}, {"text": "The planets warn you are taking a particular situation far too seriously \u2013 certainly more seriously than those around you are taking it. If it does not bother other people why are you allowing it to bother you? Think about that and then cheer up."}, {"text": "This may be a somewhat confusing weekend for you as Neptune\u2019s influence leaves you wondering whom you can trust. Your best course of action is to ignore what others say and listen to what the logical part of your brain tells you. Avoid wishful thinking."}, {"text": "Try not to make any important decisions over the next 48 hours because what you decide now may have to be reversed later on. Above all, avoid allowing the emotional side of your mind to dictate your actions, because chances are it won\u2019t end well."}, {"text": "It would appear that Neptune, planet of illusion, is clouding your ability to separate fact from fiction, especially on the home front where you seem to be on a completely different level of thinking and feeling to your nearest and dearest. Keep things simple if you can."}, {"text": "Be on your guard and take nothing for granted today and tomorrow. Everything is a bit up in the air at the moment and you could easily read too much into a perfectly normal situation and find that it spirals out of control. Keep it simple."}, {"text": "You appear to be worrying about something that in the greater scheme of things is not worth the hassle. If it has something to do with your finances then, by all means, get it checked out, but don\u2019t read more into the situation than is actually there."}, {"text": "The message of the stars this weekend is clear and simple: Be positive in everything you think, say and do and don\u2019t let people with a more negative approach to life get you down. Act as if you are master of your fate \u2013 because you always are."}, {"text": "A new moon on your birthday is a sign of better times to come, and if you are the sort of Aries who enjoys new beginnings then the next 12 months could be truly amazing. Remember though, that once you start something you then need to finish it."}, {"text": "New opportunities will arise over the next few days, and if you react quickly and decisively you could make a name for yourself, and maybe a nice chunk of money too. Don\u2019t fight change \u2013 if you work with it you can make it work for you as well."}, {"text": "The best way to help yourself is to help other people first. Today\u2019s new moon invites you to put yourself in the emotional position of someone you are close to and who is obviously struggling. It won\u2019t take you long to work out what they need."}, {"text": "Try not to argue with people who seem to enjoy causing tension where none existed before. The planets indicate that the best way to deal with those kinds of individuals is to ignore them \u2013 or at least to ignore their provocative words and actions."}, {"text": "A new moon in the career area of your chart will see you much enthused about a new ambition, but you need to keep your feet on the ground because it\u2019s unlikely to be as straightforward as you want to believe. Success takes hard work, and lots of it."}, {"text": "There is no way you are going to sway someone with facts and figures \u2013 they don\u2019t care about stuff like that. What you must do is appeal to their emotions, so lay it on thick and make them believe the world might end if they don\u2019t agree with you."}, {"text": "You may want to take something you are working on to a higher level but to do so you are going to have to invest quite a bit in it \u2013 not just time and effort but cash as well. So the first question you need to ask is: Can you afford it?"}, {"text": "The more time you spend in preparation the less time you will waste fixing mistakes that could have been avoided. Today\u2019s new moon will make it easy for you to reach out to people who have been there and done it before you. You can learn from them."}, {"text": "By all means work hard but don\u2019t knock yourself out trying to do things that are clearly beyond your capabilities. Even a Scorpio, driven as you are, must be aware of what is and is not possible, so keep it real and keep yourself fit and healthy."}, {"text": "Spell out in clear and simple terms what it is you are trying to do, and what the universe can do to assist you, and it won\u2019t be long before you are sailing along with the wind at your back. Good things come to those who follow their dreams."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to confess to family and friends that what you have been up to has gone wrong in a big way but the planets warn that might not be such a good idea. Why draw attention to your failings if others seem unaware of them?"}, {"text": "An opportunity to mingle with interesting people will come your way today and you must not turn it down. You may be surprised to discover that your ideas and their ideas are in fact quite similar. You could even end up working alongside one another."}, {"text": "By all means look ahead and make plans, both short-term and long-term, but don\u2019t forget that plans need to be paid for. The good news is that today\u2019s new moon could bring a windfall of some kind, or make ready cash much easier to come by."}, {"text": "Not everyone born under the sign of Aries is outgoing and energetic and there will be times over the coming year when you want nothing more than to be left alone with your thoughts. Make room for your inner life and your outer life will flourish too."}, {"text": "Try not to be suspicious for no good reason as the week begins. Now that the sun is moving through your sign you must keep your outlook on life in general positive and constructive at all times. No one wants to hurt you. Most people want to help you."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to waste money on things you don\u2019t need but with Mars moving through your sign in recent weeks you may have been a bit impetuous in some of your purchases. Start looking for ways to save cash rather than spend even more."}, {"text": "The pace of life may not be quite so frantic today but that\u2019s okay. In fact you will probably quite enjoy the more relaxed atmosphere as the new week begins. Make the most of it because it\u2019s unlikely to last more than a few days."}, {"text": "You will get the chance to deal with an issue that has been bothering you on and off for months. You may have to make a decision that won\u2019t be popular in certain circles but if it\u2019s the only way to move on then it\u2019s got to be done."}, {"text": "Something will happen over the next few days that compels you to question some of your most deeply held opinions and beliefs. It may not be an easy experience but it\u2019s something you need to do. Even a Leo is allowed to change their mind."}, {"text": "Refuse to settle for second best today. The standards you set at the start of the week are the standards you will be judged on throughout the week and well into next month, so aim high and don\u2019t let anyone tell you certain things cannot be done."}, {"text": "You of all people should know that appearances can be deceptive and according to the planets you could easily get something back to front, inside out, or upside down today. It might be wise, for now, not to trust everything your senses tell you."}, {"text": "Try not to scatter your energy in so many directions that you risk failing to accomplish anything of note. There are so many things you could be doing now but there is one thing you need to focus on to the exclusion of everything else."}, {"text": "Make it look as if you are enthusiastic about what you are expected to do today, even if it\u2019s actually the last thing you want to be working on. The fact is you have no choice in the matter, so smile and make an excellent job of it."}, {"text": "No matter how much someone might provoke you today you must not rise to the bait. Most likely they are doing it on purpose and hoping you will get angry, because they think it will make you look bad. They\u2019re right, it will, so don\u2019t fall for it."}, {"text": "If you hear something today that sounds too good to be true then, most likely, it isn\u2019t true and you should stay well away from it. Also, if someone tries to sweet talk you into doing something for them, just say no. Put your own needs first."}, {"text": "There is something you need to let go of and no matter what it may have meant to you in the past if you let go of it now it will soon be a distant memory. Remember, you don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s permission to make changes."}, {"text": "The way you choose to look at the world is the way the world will appear to you, so choose to be positive and loving and happy and that is what will be reflected back in your direction, not just this year but for many years to come."}, {"text": "Keep your wits about you today and don\u2019t let anyone persuade you to do things that, deep down, you know are unlikely to be in your best interests. It\u2019s good of you to want to help people but helping yourself must always be your first priority. "}, {"text": "You will meet some rather strange people over the next 48 hours, the kind of people you might not always take to \u2013 but on this occasion they will delight you. Be aware that what starts out as a simple friendship could quickly develop into something deeper."}, {"text": "You need to break free of routines and habits that have been holding you back from reaching your potential. Above all you need to overcome your tendency to focus on details to the exclusion of everything else. It\u2019s the bigger picture that matters, today and every day."}, {"text": "Do whatever takes your fancy today, then do it some more tomorrow. As values planet Venus moves into the most adventurous area of your chart you have nothing to lose and lots to gain by expanding the limits of what you believe is permissible."}, {"text": "A family or financial matter that has been causing you sleepless nights will take a turn for the better over the next few days. It may not be entirely resolved but you will realize quite quickly that it\u2019s not nearly as important as you thought it was."}, {"text": "Wherever you go and whatever you do over the next two or three days you will meet people who inspire you to improve your life. One of those people could become a very close friend and together you will do things you could not have done on your own."}, {"text": "Something will throw you off your stride today and to begin with you won\u2019t be happy about it, but as the situation develops you will realize that it might actually be a positive thing. Ultimately all change is good change, so go with the flow."}, {"text": "With Venus moving into the most dynamic area of your chart today, and linking with changes planet Uranus tomorrow, this is the perfect time to follow through on plans you have been working on for quite some time. Don\u2019t let anyone hold you back."}, {"text": "A friend or relative will do something that shocks you today but if you are smart you won\u2019t make an issue of it. It\u2019s not as if you have never done anything shocking yourself Sag, so let them get on with it and resist the urge to be judgmental."}, {"text": "You seem to be flavour of the month wherever you go at the moment and long may it continue.

Don\u2019t let their praise warp your view of reality."}, {"text": "Some people will need convincing that what you are planning is going to work but some people don\u2019t matter \u2013 the only thing that counts is that you believe in it. Get started on it immediately and don\u2019t worry if you have to start on your own."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of love and harmony, moves into your birth sign today and even if certain issues have made you a bit hot under the collar of late it\u2019s unlikely you will want to pursue them any further. Your priorities now should be on two things only; loving and laughing."}, {"text": "Has your life got a bit too predictable of late? Then do something about it. The influence of Uranus, planet of changes, on your birthday will encourage you to throw everything up in the air, just to see how and where it all comes down again."}, {"text": "Make sure you are on the move today. The planets warn if you stay where you are you will probably miss out on something you would have enjoyed. You don\u2019t have to plan where you will be going or what you will be doing \u2013 just let it happen."}, {"text": "Make the most of Mars in your sign to push ahead both at work and in your personal life. When Mars moves on at the weekend you may find it harder to motivate yourself, so whatever takes your fancy over the next few days just go for it.

Don\u2019t exhaust yourself."}, {"text": "By all means help someone in their hour of need but don\u2019t charge blindly into a situation you know nothing about.

"}, {"text": "Someone you don\u2019t really trust will offer you something you desire today and you will be mightily tempted to take it. But what will you have to give in return?

It could be the cost is too high."}, {"text": "Some of the things that take place early next week will require you to be at your most alert and your most energetic, so don\u2019t do too much now. Conserve your energy and keep an eye on changes that begin to take place over the weekend."}, {"text": "You have absolutely nothing to prove, to yourself or to anyone else. Why then do you seem to think it is necessary to set your sights higher and push yourself harder? Whatever the reason you need to get over it. Libra is about balance, and relaxation, and fun."}, {"text": "Make an effort to build bridges to people you don\u2019t always get along with. Venus in the sympathetic sign of Pisces makes it easier than usual to reach out to those who seem to be on a different level mentally and emotionally. Actually, you have a lot in common."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if you find it hard to get along with a loved one. According to the planets they have a lot on their mind and need to be left alone to focus on some rather intense personal matters. Give them the space they need."}, {"text": "Make time for people today \u2013 not just people you like and love but strangers you meet while socializing or walking the streets. If you make an effort to smile and talk to them they may surprise you, in a nice way, with some of the things they say."}, {"text": "Within a matter of days your confidence will soar. You may find that hard to believe at the moment but when Mars moves in your favour at the weekend the world will take on a much rosier hue. The world won\u2019t actually change much but your attitude will."}, {"text": "You can be quite the romantic when the mood takes you and with love planet Venus now moving through your sign it will take you quite often. Today\u2019s Venus-Uranus link suggests a new friendship could quickly develop into something more meaningful."}, {"text": "A change of emphasis is needed over the coming year, allied to a change of heart. Forget about what other people say you should be doing with your life and let your inner voice speak to you. It\u2019s the part of you that knows all the answers \u2013 so listen."}, {"text": "You know what you want and you know that sooner or later you will get it, but don\u2019t be impatient and don\u2019t be pushy when dealing with people who can be every bit as assertive as you. You\u2019ve got enough opponents as it is \u2013 don\u2019t make more."}, {"text": "Any plans you had to put on hold a few weeks ago can be started up again as from today. Recent setbacks and hold-ups may have been discouraging but looking back from the not too distant future you will realize they served a purpose."}, {"text": "As Mercury, your ruler, ends its retrograde phase today your powers of persuasion will soon be back to where they were before and even if others were able to deny you in the past they won\u2019t be able to deny you now. Move forward with confidence."}, {"text": "Go out of your way to talk to people today, even people you might prefer to avoid. What you hear from a stranger may be just what you need to raise your spirits and get you aiming high again, both in your private life and in your work."}, {"text": "If someone tries to get you to put in more hours than you are contracted for you can and you must tell them it isn\u2019t going to happen. You may be a nice guy by nature but you don\u2019t have to let people bully you. Stand up for yourself."}, {"text": "You will be able to express yourself more easily now that your ruling planet Mercury is coming out of its retrograde phase. Say what is on your mind and don\u2019t be surprised if it shakes things up a little, or even a lot. Be controversial."}, {"text": "You have been less than happy with developments on the work front of late but you will soon get the chance to change things to your benefit. Speak up about what you see as an injustice and don\u2019t be afraid to hurt other people\u2019s feelings."}, {"text": "If you have a good idea today you would be wise to keep it to yourself for the time being. Your first instinct may be to tell as many people as possible but if you do that you run the risk of someone else making your idea their own."}, {"text": "What you hear today may not be \u201cgood\u201d in the usual sense of the word but it does suggest that the tide is turning and it won\u2019t be long before your dealings with certain people get back to normal \u2013 or as close to normal as they\u2019ve ever been!"}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication, moves in your favour today, making it easy to win round people to your way of thinking. Don\u2019t waste your time on trivial matters though \u2013 focus on issues that matter in the wider world. Be a force for change."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have been expecting too much of yourself and will need to amend your plans over the next few days. The fact is you are human like everyone else and that means you have limits like everyone else. Know them and respect them."}, {"text": "You have found it difficult to trust certain people of late, and no doubt for good reason, but now that mind planet Mercury is ending its retrograde phase you can afford to be a bit more open with them. There is nothing they can do to harm you."}, {"text": "The moon\u2019s eclipse of Saturn on your birthday warns you need to guide your mind away from negative thoughts and embrace a view of the world that is wholly positive. The universe has a plan and knows what it\u2019s doing, so trust it!"}, {"text": "Whatever you say today the people around you will assume that you mean it, so don\u2019t joke or play games because they won\u2019t understand and they won\u2019t appreciate it when they realize you are just having fun. Some people have no sense of humour!"}, {"text": "It may seem as if the battle you are currently fighting cannot be won but the planets indicate that simply isn\u2019t true. You have a double advantage over your rivals that almost guarantees success \u2013 you believe in yourself totally and you never give in."}, {"text": "If you try to bluff your way out of trouble today you may just about succeed, but you will also be storing up trouble for later on when a similar situation arises. If you can\u2019t do something then just say so. It\u2019s not a sign of failure."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, push yourself hard over the next 24 hours but you really don\u2019t have to. The planets indicate that the serious stuff won\u2019t start until the early part of next week, so by all means take a break over the next few days."}, {"text": "The moon\u2019s eclipse of Saturn today means you are unlikely to be in an outgoing mood, and on the work front others will struggle to get a solitary word out of you. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll make up for it later \u2013 Leo rarely stays silent for long."}, {"text": "Can you be bothered to defend your interests? Is it worth the effort? You may be feeling a bit jaded at the moment but if you give others the impression that you have suddenly become an easy touch they will try to take advantage. Get with it Virgo!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t give up on something just because you are finding it harder than you expected. A little bit of extra effort now will pay off big time early next month, so get your act together and push yourself past whatever barrier is holding you back."}, {"text": "If you need to ask a friend for a favour of some kind them make your approach today. However, you must not be vague about what you want, or what you can offer them in return. Be serious about your aims \u2013 and they will be serious about supporting you."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks they can get their way by shedding a few tears obviously does not know you too well. The lunar eclipse of Saturn means you are in no mood to allow yourself to be emotionally blackmailed. A hard heart is a good heart today."}, {"text": "By all means tread on a few toes if it makes it easier to get whatever it is you desire. The very last thing you should be worrying about now is hurting other people\u2019s feelings. Would they worry about your feelings if the situation was reversed?"}, {"text": "You may be in a playful mood but some of the people around you are in a ridiculously negative frame of mind. It might be best to steer clear of such people today and over the weekend. Don\u2019t let them drag you down to their level."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to let things hold you back from enjoying yourself. Whatever may be going on in the wider world you are still master of your own fate, so cheer up and find ways to have fun. You\u2019re at your best with a smile on your face."}, {"text": "You will embark on a journey of inner discovery over the coming 12 months, one that never truly ends. Don\u2019t be afraid to look deep inside yourself, because what you discover in there will have an enormous effect on the quality of your life out here."}, {"text": "You will want to do good deeds for people this weekend, which is wonderful, but don\u2019t get carried away and let them have things you should be keeping for yourself. As Mars moves in your favor tomorrow you must remember to take as well as give."}, {"text": "Go with the flow over the next 48 hours and don\u2019t worry if you end up some place you were not expecting to be. Wherever it is, and whoever you interact with while you are there, it is part of your life\u2019s design, so embrace it and enjoy it."}, {"text": "The more you have focused on your inner life in recent weeks the more you will now move in the other direction and focus on the world at large. There is so much that is exciting and enticing out there. Get involved and make your mark."}, {"text": "You\u2019ve got that feeling again that you must do something to prove yourself. You may have no idea where it comes from or why it should strike you at this particular moment but it\u2019s there and you have to respond to it. Put on a show."}, {"text": "Instead of rushing into a new situation, or trying to bend an old situation so it works more to your liking, just back off and let things happen. The planets indicate that your best strategy by far is to respond to events rather than to initiate them."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority is going to get on your case this weekend and it won\u2019t be easy to live up to what they expect of you. But the fact that it isn\u2019t easy means you will strive harder, and in striving you may create something great."}, {"text": "All sorts of exciting things are going on around you at the moment but if you are smart you will ignore each and every one of them and focus on finishing something that, while maybe a bit dull by comparison, will give you a real sense of achievement."}, {"text": "Someone is sure to disagree with your plans this weekend but, of course, that won\u2019t worry you a bit. It\u2019s not what people think, or even say, that matters but what they do, and you are one of life\u2019s major doers \u2013 that\u2019s why others envy you."}, {"text": "You will have to make a difficult choice today: either you support a friend, even though you know that what they\u2019ve done is wrong, or you turn against them and side with the powers that be. It\u2019s got to be one or the other \u2013 there is no middle way."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks they can do better than you by working harder than you has clearly never seen you in action. As Mars moves into the work area of your chart this weekend so your energy will soar \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean you can afford to waste it."}, {"text": "You need to channel your talents in a direction that benefits you rather than other people. Yes, of course, you can still help those less fortunate than yourself but your good works must not take up most of your time. Be good to yourself."}, {"text": "Can you persuade partners and colleagues to follow your lead? Do you really need to? Or even want to? These are the sort of questions you will be asking yourself over the next 48 hours. Make sure the answers you get make life easier, not harder."}, {"text": "You may not be much for planning but the cosmic picture on your birthday demands that you look ahead and map out the route you intend to take. If you can do that then success beyond your wildest dreams is pretty much guaranteed."}, {"text": "If you can\u2019t find a way to handle an important task on your own then you must ask for assistance. Friends and colleagues will do anything for you today if you ask them politely, but they won\u2019t lift a finger to help if you don\u2019t speak up."}, {"text": "This is a really good time to impress employers and other important people. You will find it so easy to put across your ideas that even those who are slow on the uptake will get it immediately. Make sure you get the rewards and applause."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to hide the truth from partners and loved ones because they know you too well and can tell when you are trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Admit what you did and ask for their forgiveness. You\u2019ll get it, of course."}, {"text": "Your attitude toward a project you are committed to is beginning to change and it may be the case that you start looking round for ways to get out of it. It can be done, but at what cost? It\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about your reputation too."}, {"text": "You must let everyone know what it is you are planning today. If you try to keep anything hidden others are sure to find out about it and their trust in you will diminish. Most people value honesty, so be open about what you are up to."}, {"text": "You need to let certain individuals know that you have no intention of doing what they ask of you, not just because you don\u2019t agree with it but because the situation is clearly set up to be profitable to them. Don\u2019t let it be at your expense."}, {"text": "The sooner you start making changes the better, and today\u2019s Mars-Saturn link should give you the touch of ruthlessness you have been lacking of late. Anything that does not contribute to what you are trying to do must be junked \u2013 and that goes for people too."}, {"text": "You need to prepare yourself for some kind of domestic showdown. You also need to promise yourself that you will stay in control of your emotions at all times \u2013 and mean it. A cool head and a calm heart are more essential than ever."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t find it hard to persuade others to do what you want them to do today but try not to be too aggressive about it. Persuasion always works better than coercion, so spell out the benefits of why they should assist you. They\u2019ll get the message."}, {"text": "Make sure you know what the facts are before getting involved in business deals of any kind. If someone suggests something they say will make you money, but can\u2019t come up with the figures to support their claim, then give it a miss. It\u2019s not worth the risk."}, {"text": "There can be no more excuses for putting off something you know has to be done. Today\u2019s Mars-Saturn link in your sign demands that you get your act together and see it through to the end. No one can do it for you, so get on with it!"}, {"text": "You must not allow vague worries and fears to hold you back in any way. If you attempt something and it goes wrong, at least you will have tried. If you fail to even try you may never forgive yourself \u2013 and your partners won\u2019t forgive you either."}, {"text": "Make a list of all the things you do in your life that are wasteful, that don\u2019t take you closer to your ultimate goal. Then junk them all. The message of your birthday chart is that you need to be ruthless this year, in particular with yourself."}, {"text": "Try not to do or say anything that might upset people in positions of authority. Yes, it\u2019s good that you are not afraid to be outspoken but some days it\u2019s wiser to keep your thoughts to yourself, and this is most certainly one of them."}, {"text": "Avoid conflicts and confrontations over the next few days, even if you know that you are in the right and even if you know that you can defend your position. The best path to take is the path of least resistance, at least for now."}, {"text": "You seem to be rather sensitive to criticism at the moment and if anyone even hints that you may be on the wrong track you will most likely give them a verbal mauling. Just be careful your touchy mood does not cause unnecessary trouble."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to ignore the advice of a friend and take the kind of risk you would usually seek to avoid, and you are perfectly entitled to do so. However, be aware that if you get it wrong the blame will be entirely on you."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, force through changes that you know other people won\u2019t like, but is it worth the aggravation? A few days from now the situation will look very different indeed, so try not to be hasty. Don\u2019t rush things \u2013 time is your friend."}, {"text": "You will go out of your way over the next few days to prove the doubters and critics wrong. But it is of the utmost importance that you do so legitimately \u2013 that is, using facts and figures that are genuine rather than wishful thinking."}, {"text": "If a work colleague tells you one thing today but a family member tells you another, which one do you believe? According to the planets your colleague\u2019s advice is likely to be more accurate, simply because they are not as emotionally involved."}, {"text": "This is not a time for talking, this is a time for doing, so get up and get on with what you know you should be doing. The more confidence you have in your own abilities the more likely it is your efforts will be a success."}, {"text": "You may be the sort of person who enjoys making quick decisions but the planets warn that you need to consider your options very carefully today before making your next move. Avoid taking unnecessary risks, especially where money and business issues are concerned."}, {"text": "Try not to fear the worst as the new week begins \u2013 despite what some people say there is no need to think that the sky is about to fall. Capricorns have a reputation for maintaining their composure even in the toughest situations. Live up to it."}, {"text": "You can usually be trusted not to let your emotions cloud your judgment but as some of your more deep-seated fears are being forced to the surface that may not be so easy today. Push past those fears and do what needs to be done."}, {"text": "What happens today may seem weird but it\u2019s important that you take it seriously and don\u2019t just ignore it. There are a lot of things out there in the big wide world that you don\u2019t know much about, so be open to new ideas and new experiences."}, {"text": "Your imagination will run riot over the coming 12 months and that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your overall outlook on life. Always look for the deeper meaning in what happens, and always believe that good will ultimately prevail."}, {"text": "You want to get along with people but not everyone wants to get along with you. One individual in particular seems intent on starting a feud over next to nothing. You may be tempted to give them what they want but don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not worth it."}, {"text": "You will find it easy to impress important people today but work colleagues and employers won\u2019t be impressed if you exaggerate what you can do. Be honest with them about your abilities and your limitations. They don\u2019t expect you to be Superman."}, {"text": "You cannot expect other people to believe in you if you don\u2019t believe in yourself. Today\u2019s Mercury-Neptune link may make you doubt yourself in various ways but you must not let that doubt show. Put on an act \u2013 pretend nothing fazes you."}, {"text": "What\u2019s with the false modesty? Yes, of course, being a Cancerian you tend not to make a big noise about your talents but too much modesty can actually be a bad thing. Let people in positions of authority know who you are and what you can do."}, {"text": "There is no guarantee you will get what you desire but you must go all out for it anyway. If it is destined to be yours then the universe will find ways to give it to you. If it isn\u2019t, then readjust your sights and aim for something else."}, {"text": "The only thing that can hold you back now is if you believe what certain people are telling you \u2013 in particular that some tasks are too much for you and you should lower your expectations. Chances are they just don\u2019t want you to outshine them."}, {"text": "Despite what some people may be telling you the world is not about to end, so be positive in your outlook and work toward making things better in practical ways. Life is rarely, if ever, as bad as some people like to think it is."}, {"text": "It does not matter how many little things have gone wrong in recent weeks, what matters is that one really big thing is still going right. Focus on that one big thing today and ignore everything else. History is made a step at a time."}, {"text": "Your task today is to patch up a friendship that has gone downhill a bit of late. It does not matter who was to blame, it matters only that you are prepared to make the first move and make it a friendly one. They will respond to your generosity."}, {"text": "Anything to do with your material situation should go well today but don\u2019t take unnecessary risks. If it\u2019s your money that is on the line you must insist on guarantees so that, if things do go wrong, your personal exposure to loss is limited."}, {"text": "You need to get out into the world and let other people know you exist. The sun in Aries at this time of year makes that easier to do but the effort must still come from you. Don\u2019t be afraid to stand up and make yourself heard."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s Mercury-Neptune link in your sign means you will know without a shadow of a doubt what is right and what is wrong and what you need personally to do about it. Don\u2019t follow the crowd, listen to your heart and trust your instincts."}, {"text": "You will need to reconcile conflicting ambitions over the coming year and it won\u2019t be easy. The best way may be to compartmentalize your affairs so personal and professional aims don\u2019t clash. Scheduling and time management will be of the utmost importance."}, {"text": "You enjoy taking risks and will take them by the dozen today. The sun in your sign gives you the feeling that whatever you do and however outrageous or impossible it may look to other people it will work for you. Let\u2019s hope you are right!"}, {"text": "Try to be a bit more assertive when dealing with family issues. Show loved ones that you won\u2019t allow yourself to be pushed around, not even by them. Don\u2019t worry if you put a nose or two out of joint \u2013 the only nose that matters is your own."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be lost for words today \u2013 in fact they will flow out of you faster than ever. Those who annoy you, even in small ways, could find themselves on the receiving end of a verbal blast they are unlikely to forget in a hurry."}, {"text": "If an opportunity opens up for you today you must go for it without a moment\u2019s hesitation. You are not the only one looking to get ahead of the game, so make sure you are first when it comes to taking advantage of whatever changes take place."}, {"text": "You are in one of your devil-may-care moods at the moment and that\u2019s good. Just remember that while your energy and enthusiasm may galvanize those around you not everyone will have the stamina to keep up with you. Some will inevitably fall behind."}, {"text": "Something unexpected is likely to occur over the next 24 hours and to begin with it may disturb you a bit, but if you stay calm and look at the situation logically you will soon realize there are ways you can benefit from the situation."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let anyone \u2013 not even the people you love most in this life \u2013 persuade you to give up on a goal that means so much to you. If you have made a decision then you must stick with it, even at the risk of falling out with them."}, {"text": "You are in one of those moods where you hate to waste time, and the way some people are so laidback about life really annoys you. In which case you should try to work on your own over the next 24 hours, for their benefit and your own."}, {"text": "Both in your personal life and at work you will be somewhat excitable over the next two or three days, but that\u2019s probably no bad thing as life has been a bit short on thrills in recent weeks. Do whatever it takes to liven things up."}, {"text": "Do you stick with routines and methods you feel comfortable with, or do you strike out in a new direction and hope for the best? Listen to what friends and family members suggest \u2013 then do the opposite. You don\u2019t have to play safe like them."}, {"text": "This has the potential to be a fun time of year but to make the most of it you need to stop worrying what other people might think about you. Even if they think the worst, so what? A hundred years from now who is going to care?"}, {"text": "You must make sure you are working as much for yourself as you are for other people. By all means help partners and loved ones and friends in whatever way you can, but it must not be to the detriment of your own dreams and schemes."}, {"text": "Things will start to fall into place over the next 12 months and you will begin to understand that recent events are part of a wider and deeper cosmic plan. Once you have seen the bigger picture, make sure you don\u2019t lose sight of it again."}, {"text": "Tomorrow\u2019s new moon falls in your sign, making all things possible. This is very much a time of new beginnings, for heading off in a new direction and doing things that have not been done before, so get up, get at it and make your mark."}, {"text": "You need to face up to a problem that has been nagging at you for weeks, months, maybe even years. Don\u2019t be afraid to look inside yourself and confront whatever feelings you discover buried under all the everyday stuff that keeps it hidden."}, {"text": "Allow yourself to dream. Allow yourself to believe that all things are possible. More than anything now you need something to aim for, something so big and so challenging that there is no room for half measures \u2013 it\u2019s win or bust!"}, {"text": "Your reputation is likely to blossom over the next few days as you rise to whatever challenges are in front of you and show the world you have what it takes to operate at the highest level. Cancer is a cardinal sign \u2013 you were born to succeed."}, {"text": "You seem to be in a thoughtful mood at the moment, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but you need to be active as well. Take advantage of the approaching new moon to set yourself new targets \u2013 and make them not just big, but huge! "}, {"text": "Sometimes you can be a bit too suspicious for your own good and the planets indicate you don\u2019t want to say anything you think rivals and competitors may be able to use against you. That\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ve still got to say something."}, {"text": "You should put your own plans on hold over the next two or three days and do what you can to assist a loved one with some kind of emotional issue. Chances are you will quite enjoy helping them \u2013 it feels good to know how much they need you."}, {"text": "If you know what you want today you won\u2019t have any trouble getting it. You are in one of those moods when you simply won\u2019t allow anything to come between you and your goal. Others will sense this and keep out of your way."}, {"text": "Tomorrow\u2019s new moon will do wonders for your confidence but there is a danger that, in typical Sagittarian fashion, you will go too far and say or do something that turns others against you. Will you care? Only if the moon really is made of cheese!"}, {"text": "No matter what certain people may tell you there is no reason at all why you should change your ways or even your way of looking at the world. You are who you are and you do what you do and if others don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s too bad!"}, {"text": "Something you say over the next 24 hours is unlikely to go down well with friends and relatives, but say it anyway. You are under no obligation to watch your words just because some people are ultrasensitive. Call it as you see it."}, {"text": "Your cash-flow situation needs looking at \u2013 not at some point in the future but right now. The simple fact is you cannot go on spending money as if you have an unlimited supply of the stuff. Earn more or spend less \u2013 even better, do both."}, {"text": "A new moon on your birthday makes this the perfect time to sweep away the past and start again from scratch. The less emotional baggage you have the more likely it is you will discover the destiny that was designed by the universe specifically for you."}, {"text": "Even if the odds are stacked against you at the moment you will find a way to win. The new moon in your sign means you don\u2019t know the meaning of the word failure and with that kind of confidence in yourself all things are possible."}, {"text": "You may have all sorts of doubts swirling round your mind but you must not let them show. Even if you fear the worst you must act as if you are super-confident. The funny thing is the more you pretend the more likely it is to be true."}, {"text": "According to your solar chart you are trying far too hard to impress other people. Just relax and give expression to whatever thoughts come into your mind. You tend to be at your best when you don\u2019t plan in too much detail. Live in the moment."}, {"text": "Self-improvement is the name of the game at the moment, so give some thought to what areas of your life you would like to expand and increase and then focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Your talents are huge, so use them."}, {"text": "It\u2019s okay to be easygoing. It\u2019s okay to be laidback. In fact it\u2019s more than okay now that the moon is new in one of the best areas of your chart \u2013 it\u2019s essential. A laidback Leo is a creative Leo, and a creative Leo is loved by everyone."}, {"text": "Keep your guard up today because the planets warn that someone you work or do business with may try to cheat you. On the other hand, don\u2019t be too suspicious. You should know by now who you can trust, so don\u2019t treat everyone as a rival."}, {"text": "Go out of your way today to do what partners and loved ones want you to do. Don\u2019t think of it as giving up your own freedom, think of it as expanding the freedom you have to do things together. Your ideas and interests will coincide almost perfectly."}, {"text": "Not everyone will approve of the methods you use today but that won\u2019t worry you in the slightest. In fact you will take it as evidence that your way is the best way, and it\u2019s that kind of self-belief that guarantees your ongoing success. "}, {"text": "A new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart makes this one of the best days for getting things done, both in your personal life and on the work front. Don\u2019t start in too mad a rush though \u2013 you\u2019ve got all the time in the world."}, {"text": "Be positive about what you have to do today, even if you would prefer to be doing something else. Your efforts will have a hugely positive effect on other people even if they don\u2019t much help you \u2013 but eventually the universe will repay you in kind."}, {"text": "Try not to waste time finishing tasks that should have been completed by now. If you have not got to the end of what you have been working on then chances are you never will, so junk it and start something new \u2013 and finish that instead."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon indicates that you can find a solution to a family or financial problem that has been keeping you awake at night. The trick is to stop trying to dictate events and to let them guide you instead. They\u2019ll point you in the right direction."}, {"text": "You enjoy working on your own and you certainly get more done than most, but over the coming year you must join forces with like-minded people. Don\u2019t think of it as losing your precious independence, think of it as being part of a powerful team."}, {"text": "The important thing this weekend is that you knuckle down and get things done. The planets indicate that if you are willing, especially socially and on the work front, you will impress the kind of people whose support could be invaluable."}, {"text": "Try not to get angry with someone who has let you down because it means you will most likely carry that mood with you well into next week. Whatever errors they may have committed they\u2019re not really important in the greater scheme of things."}, {"text": "There is so much going on around you at the moment that you may feel a bit left out of things. But in a way that\u2019s good because it means you can act as you please without getting noticed. That\u2019s not an invitation to behave badly though!"}, {"text": "Jupiter in the work area of your chart gives you so much physical and mental energy that you can get twice as much done as you usually do. But don\u2019t go to extremes and take on too many duties and responsibilities. Know your limits and respect them."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you and to make the most of it you need to be involved in something of a creative nature and you need to be on the move. Aim to accomplish something that really stands out this weekend."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t think you can bottle up your feelings and carry on as normal. The harder you try to disguise what is going on in your head and your heart the more clues you will give those around you that something is wrong. You must open up."}, {"text": "Partnership activities are under excellent stars at the moment, so don\u2019t hide yourself away where you cannot be seen \u2013 get out into the world and give people the chance to experience your Libra humor and hospitality. You have so much to give."}, {"text": "This promises to be a good weekend for work-related matters, so forget about taking it easy and focus on tasks that need to be completed quite soon. It may surprise you how quickly and efficiently you work your way through them."}, {"text": "You may be in a dynamic frame of mind at the moment but that does not mean you have an excuse to brush other people aside while you pursue your goals. It\u2019s not what you do on your own that will be remembered, but what you do with others."}, {"text": "At last you seem ready to accept the fact that the more you worry the less likely it is you will be able to overcome the obstacles that are in your way. Attitude is everything in life, so get your head right and your future will be bright."}, {"text": "Some people delight in being negative and trying to knock down your ideas. Ignore them. The planets suggest that if you believe in something enough you will find a way to make it happen, so close your ears to criticism and listen only to your inner voice."}, {"text": "You seem a lot less uptight now about taking on new responsibilities and that\u2019s good because you are about to be asked to do something that will test both your existing knowledge and your ability to learn something new. Treat it as a challenge to be enjoyed."}, {"text": "Your energy levels will be extremely high over the coming 12 months, but for best results you should try to work consciously with other people toward shared goals. Small groups of people with burning ideals have been known to change the world."}, {"text": "If you are feeling a bit low at the moment then throw yourself into activities that require your full attention. One of the best ways to get over your worries and woes is to support people who are worse off than you \u2013 there are plenty of them."}, {"text": "A quick decision may not be the best decision but the planets indicate you may have no choice but to act quickly today. Be bold, on the work front especially, but be ready for a backlash from people who would prefer you not to rock the boat."}, {"text": "The planets warn if you come on too strong today you could put a friendship at risk. You may have strong opinions about something but this is probably not the best time to make an issue of them. Find something less controversial to talk about."}, {"text": "You may need to give a boost to your financial situation but you must not do so in ways that alienate other people, especially your friends. Money is important, of course, but cold cash can never replace the warm glow that comes from human communication."}, {"text": "You certainly don\u2019t lack for energy or ambition at the moment but today\u2019s Mars-Uranus link warns you could easily take things too far and turn against you the very people you most need on your side. Don\u2019t just act and assume they will support you."}, {"text": "It\u2019s true that you need to push a few boundaries, but you also need to be aware that the more risks you take the more likely it is that things could go wrong. The world can be a fulfilling place, of course, but it can be a dangerous place too!"}, {"text": "If you are prepared to work, as an equal, with other people today then you could accomplish something very special. However, if you turn inward and choose to go it alone then your successes may seem a bit hollow. It\u2019s all about sharing Libra."}, {"text": "Your destiny is not set in stone. It may be true that the general pattern of your life is established at the time of your birth but within that pattern you still possess free will. Watch out for those cosmic hints today, but always make your own decisions."}, {"text": "You will be tempted to rush things over the next 24 hours, but that may not be such a good idea. On the work front especially it will pay you to take what you are doing a careful step at a time instead of moving ahead in leaps and bounds."}, {"text": "You may be in the mood to take risks but today\u2019s Mars-Uranus link warns you could end up in an untidy heap if you make the wrong call. You could also end up seriously out of pocket, so take your time, be cautious, and get it right."}, {"text": "As Mars in your sign makes a less than positive angle to your ruling planet Uranus you may find there are unexpected consequences to the actions you take. Try to look ahead and envisage what the effects of what you are doing might be."}, {"text": "You are usually good at keeping your emotions under wraps but the cosmic picture suggests that something could easily set you off and before you know it the whole wide world will know how you feel. It may take a while for the world to recover!"}, {"text": "By all means be generous with your time, your energy and your money over the coming 12 months, but be sensible too. You only have so much to give, so make sure it goes to the right people for the right reasons. That means saying \u201cno\u201d occasionally."}, {"text": "No matter what some people may try to tell you there is no need to prove that what you are doing has value to the wider community. What matters is that it has value to you \u2013 everything else of importance will follow on from that."}, {"text": "If people you are negotiating with sense that you are desperate to get a deal they will most likely push up the price or make unreasonable demands. Pretend you don\u2019t care if you reach an agreement or not, then they will act in good faith."}, {"text": "You may be ambitious by nature but you also need to accept there are some goals that are likely to remain out of reach, at least for the time being, and what happens today will prepare you for that. Be positive but know your limits too."}, {"text": "You may not be in the mood to work hard as the new week begins but that\u2019s not a bad thing. Start at a slower pace than usual and build up speed as you go along. If you hit top speed immediately you may exhaust yourself by midweek."}, {"text": "You need to tighten your belt and you need to do so immediately. Any spending plans you have in the pipeline must be put on hold for a week, a month, maybe even longer, until you get your financial affairs under control. Everything else is of minor importance."}, {"text": "It may annoy you that certain individuals need to be convinced that you genuinely care for them but the fact is some people cannot take things like that for granted. Do something today that shows your heart was, is and always will be with them."}, {"text": "Mars in the most adventurous area of your chart boosts your imaginative powers but other influences warn you need to keep your feet on the ground. Whatever you choose to do over the coming week make sure it has a solid and practical foundation."}, {"text": "Your expectations, both of yourself and other people, are high as always but the planets warn you could be expecting too much of someone who clearly is not on your level when it comes to ability and commitment. Let them break free and move at their own pace."}, {"text": "You need to steer clear of other people\u2019s fights and feuds, especially if there are relationship issues involved that you don\u2019t know a great deal about. There are few things more dangerous than getting stuck in the middle of an emotional battle."}, {"text": "Do what you feel like doing, not what other people say you should be doing. Saturn in your sign boosts your sense of responsibility but you need to understand that your main responsibility is always to yourself and your own ideals and beliefs."}, {"text": "By all means pay out for something you genuinely need but don\u2019t waste money on things that serve no practical purpose. Someone is watching to see how easily you can be parted from your cash \u2013 don\u2019t encourage them to target your wallet."}, {"text": "No matter which way you turn there seems to be a hard luck story you have to listen to, but you are advised to ignore each and every one of them. That may sound harsh but, seriously, most of what you hear is likely to be grossly exaggerated."}, {"text": "Never think that you cannot make a difference in the world. Never think that your contribution is too small to get noticed. The message of your birthday chart is that you have something worthwhile to give, so start giving now and don\u2019t ever stop!"}, {"text": "It\u2019s great that you can act on the spur of the moment and make a success of what you do but you still need to have some kind of plan in place for the next few days. Even an Aries can benefit from looking ahead a bit."}, {"text": "If you are not entirely sure that what you are about to embark on is right for you then call a halt. It\u2019s better to lose a bit of face now than have to admit later on, after you\u2019ve started, that you don\u2019t know what you are doing."}, {"text": "It may look as if someone has more power than you and can therefore tell you what to do but chances are their authority is not backed up by anything that need scare you. Call their bluff and see what they do about it \u2013 most likely nothing at all."}, {"text": "Just because a friend is having a hard time expressing themselves does not mean they have nothing to say. On the contrary, the planets suggest that what they have to tell you is going to be of huge importance, so be patient and listen carefully."}, {"text": "You rarely take kindly to advice and almost certainly you will pay no heed to what a work colleague tells you today. That\u2019s a shame because they appear to know something that you do not, and career-wise it could be a very important something."}, {"text": "Some people like to take the credit when things go right but make out it\u2019s nothing to do with them when things go wrong. But you\u2019re not some people, you\u2019re a Virgo and honest by nature, so admit your mistake and then put it behind you."}, {"text": "The more you try to figure something out the further away the answer seems to be, so take the hint and give your brain a rest. This is one of those problems that can only be solved by standing back and letting the whole picture come into focus."}, {"text": "You are no stranger to dealing with unpleasant situations but that does not mean you have to clean up a mess that is not of your making. If it\u2019s for someone you love then do what you can to assist. If not, give the Good Samaritan act a miss."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to hide your feelings from people who know you well because even if you manage to keep the look on your face neutral your body language will give you away. It\u2019s okay to be open about how you feel."}, {"text": "It\u2019s unlikely that you will see eye-to-eye with people in authority today, and if it\u2019s you who is the boss then it\u2019s unlikely that your employees will understand you. No matter. Whether you are giving orders or receiving them don\u2019t ask questions, just act."}, {"text": "You can\u2019t seem to put your finger on what\u2019s going on at the moment, but is that because other people are being evasive or because you\u2019re not as clued in as you think you are? Quite likely it\u2019s the latter, so wake up to reality."}, {"text": "You may think that you have covered every angle but can you be sure? The planets suggest that something you have missed, even something quite small, has the potential to stop you in your tracks \u2013 so open your eyes and find out what it is."}, {"text": "The coming 12 months won\u2019t always be easy but there will be something new for you to learn each and every day. What is your philosophy of life? What ideals sustain you? You need to have some kind of belief system to fall back on."}, {"text": "If you make a mistake today you must expect your rivals to make a big thing of it, because if you look bad it makes them look good, or so they think. Don\u2019t let it get to you. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, only even better than before."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to bluff your way out of a tight situation but with the sun at odds with Saturn today your efforts could easily backfire. If you have made an error of some kind then why not just admit it? No one expects you to be perfect."}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you stay on good terms with partners and colleagues over the next few days. There are a number of issues you could fall out over but none of them are worth the time or the effort. Find ways to compromise."}, {"text": "If a friend has been taking you for granted of late then you really must do something about it. Find a way to let them know that you are quite capable of going off on your own, that you don\u2019t actually need their friendship. They\u2019ll get the message."}, {"text": "The people who do best in life are usually the ones who know how to quit when they are ahead. Are you one of them? The planets indicate you have gone as far as you can with one particular course of action. Time to cash in and move on."}, {"text": "Jupiter, planet of good fortune, begins one of its retrograde phases today, and as it occupies the domestic area of your chart it means you need to be extra careful when dealing with family issues. Remember, some people can be incredibly touchy."}, {"text": "You need to accept that there is something you want to change that you are not going to be able to change. Once you recognize that fact you will find it easier to move on to situations that you can influence in some way. Choose the right battles."}, {"text": "Something really trivial will annoy you today but you must not let your anger show. Put on your poker face and pretend that you could not care in the slightest what certain people say and do. And get over it as soon as you can."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if something you had high hopes for has not worked out. The sun at odds with Saturn means you are not the only one who will experience disappointment. But you are one of the few who has what it takes to get past your frustration."}, {"text": "You are on the verge of taking an important decision but with your ruling planet Saturn at odds with the sun today you are strongly advised to wait a bit longer. There could be other options available, options you have yet to consider."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your precious time asking other people what they think of your aims and ambitions \u2013 it\u2019s what you think that will determine whether or not they are successful. It\u2019s never too early, or too late, to trust yourself \u2013 and be a winner."}, {"text": "If you make an effort to help someone in need today it\u2019s unlikely you will get any thanks for it, but make it anyway. The universe will notice your act of kindness and at some point in the future you will receive an act of kindness in return."}, {"text": "The most important thing over the coming year is that you rely on your own ideas and your own ingenuity. Yes, of course, you should listen to what other people tell you, but there is precious little they can tell you that the inner you does not know already."}, {"text": "Try not to make too big a fuss about something today or others may start wondering if you\u2019ve got a guilty conscience. Saturn\u2019s influence in the career area of your chart means there are people out there who would like nothing more than to see you squirm."}, {"text": "According to the planets you are not making nearly enough noise on the work front at the moment. If you want to get noticed \u2013 and you should \u2013 then you must find a way to raise your own voice above the verbal chaos that surrounds you."}, {"text": "Your best chance of success is to approach your objective from an unusual angle. If you telegraph your intentions it will make it easier for rivals to get in your way and block you from reaching your goal. Be smart and don\u2019t let that happen."}, {"text": "You may not want to hear what a friend or loved one tells you today but you know they are right and you know you must follow their advice. There is no point being stubborn just for the sake of your ego \u2013 your money situation matters more."}, {"text": "It\u2019s never easy for you to keep your opinions to yourself but the planets warn in no uncertain terms that if you open your mouth you will create all sorts of bad feeling. You don\u2019t have to be critical Leo \u2013 you can just let it pass."}, {"text": "Try not to be quite so intense over the next 24 hours. Yesterday\u2019s sun-Saturn link may have knocked your confidence a bit but it will pass and it won\u2019t be long before you are back to your best, so lighten up and let the sunshine in."}, {"text": "A lot of people will be saying how much they love and respect each other today, but you may be reluctant to give your own feelings their head. Which does not mean you don\u2019t have feelings, only that you would prefer not to make them known."}, {"text": "Something that looked simple from a distance may turn out to be rather difficult when seen close up. Be that as it may you have the tools to make a success of it, so get stuck in and enjoy the flattering feedback when it is finally done."}, {"text": "Let someone know why you are not happy with them but do so in a way that does not turn them against you. You may have a right to be annoyed but there is no point making a scene of it. Criticize them in private, not in public."}, {"text": "You have been trying too hard to please other people when you should be doing what pleases you. Make it your priority now to put your own needs first and give no thought to what others say you should be doing. Trust your instincts \u2013 and act."}, {"text": "If you turn on the charm between now and the weekend no one will be able to deny you. Both in your personal life and at work you will find it ridiculously easy to persuade people that their needs and your needs are one and the same."}, {"text": "Try not to be too aggressive today. It may be necessary to get vocal about what needs to be done but there is a fine line between looking dynamic and looking despotic. Persuasion is always better than coercion, so talk your way to success."}, {"text": "Something (or someone) that has been holding you back from being more adventurous needs to be dealt with \u2013 not tomorrow or the day after but right now. Free yourself from restrictions then strike out in a new direction. The world is yours to enjoy."}, {"text": "Make a point of ignoring a friend\u2019s bad points and focusing just on their good points today. They may be in need of correction but they will respond better to positive advice than they will to criticism. They\u2019ll get the message \u2013 and you\u2019ll stay friends."}, {"text": "Try not to put pen to paper on any kind of deal today. In fact, don\u2019t even make verbal promises. Why? Because communications planet Mercury warns you cannot be sure that the other party is going to keep to their side of the bargain."}, {"text": "If someone asks what you think or how you feel today they had better be ready for some straight talking. You are in no mood to pretend that everything is fine when it clearly is not. The truth needs to be said \u2013 and you\u2019ll say it loud!"}, {"text": "If someone asks you to help them out with their workload today by all means do what you can, but make sure you don\u2019t end up doing it all. Sometimes you can be a bit too nice for your own good. Don\u2019t let them take advantage of you. "}, {"text": "You have no intention of pulling your punches today \u2013 you have something to say and you are going to say it long and loud. Anyone who cannot handle the truth had best move as far away from you as they can. Take no prisoners."}, {"text": "Try not to read too much into a situation that is actually quite simple. Most likely someone is deliberately making it look more complicated than it is so they can get your sympathy, and maybe your money too. You\u2019re not that gullible \u2013 are you? "}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you watch what you say over the next 24 hours. You may be tempted to target someone who is getting too big for their boots but that could have serious repercussions. Resist the urge to make fun of them."}, {"text": "You believe in yourself 100 per cent but it seems not everyone thinks you have what it takes. Go out of your way to prove you\u2019re not just good, but great, at what you do. Make it so that even your enemies can no longer deny that fact. "}, {"text": "Try not to get carried away with your own importance today. Yes, you are enjoying a run of good fortune that is thoroughly deserved but it\u2019s not smart to make a big noise about it if it makes you a bigger target as well."}, {"text": "No matter what you say over the next 24 hours someone is sure to misinterpret your words. Whether they do so deliberately or by mistake is neither here nor there \u2013 you can and you must spell it out for them so the confusion doesn\u2019t linger."}, {"text": "You may be inclined to do something dramatic to get yourself noticed but it isn\u2019t necessary \u2013 in fact it could be counterproductive. The planets warn that certain people are watching your every move and checking your every word, so be careful."}, {"text": "Mercury in your sign is poorly aligned to Jupiter, planet of excess, today, which means you need to take extra care when you open your mouth. Yes, of course, you are entitled to your opinions but that does not mean other people have to agree with you."}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link on your birthday means the coming year will be make or break for you. The more ambitious an Aries you are the more you will find yourself in the spotlight. It may not always be comfortable but you can learn to enjoy it."}, {"text": "You will be challenged like never before this weekend, and you will rise to that challenge and overcome it with ease. But don\u2019t start thinking it will be this easy every day \u2013 on the contrary, there are even bigger challenges to face up ahead."}, {"text": "You must listen to what other people tell you over the next 48 hours. The fact that you don\u2019t want to hear means that you need to hear for the sake of your own mental and emotional wellbeing. Don\u2019t be too headstrong for your own good."}, {"text": "If you want something done this weekend you will need to get help from people who know their business inside out. You may be a gifted amateur but the planets indicate that only a true professional can make it happen for you."}, {"text": "It may seem as if someone in a position of authority has got it in for you but it\u2019s more likely that you are reading too much into the situation. Keep your doubts to yourself and, as much as you can, keep a low profile as well."}, {"text": "Promise yourself that you won\u2019t get involved in any kind of fight or feud, and make sure you keep that promise. As the sun, your ruler, is at odds with Pluto today, a minor falling out could easily turn into a full-scale war. You don\u2019t need that."}, {"text": "Most of the time you think with your head first and only bring in what your heart tells you later on. However, the planets warn that everything will be more emotionally charged than usual this weekend, so don\u2019t be surprised if, this time, your heart wins."}, {"text": "If a partnership is not working out the way you wanted it to most likely it\u2019s because you are expecting too much of each other. Sit down together and discuss your individual needs and desires \u2013 and be honest, because without honesty it may never work."}, {"text": "Keep your more outrageous thoughts to yourself over the next 48 hours. They may not seem outrageous to you but very few people share your ability to look at life in a dispassionate way \u2013 and even fewer have the guts to act on what they see."}, {"text": "The sun in Aries at this time of year makes you feel like a winner, and indeed you are, but because the sun is currently under the influence of power planet Pluto you need to take care when dealing with authority figures. You\u2019ve got enough opponents."}, {"text": "Leave the past where it belongs and focus only on the future. Today\u2019s sun-Pluto link will give you the touch of ruthlessness you need to cut out of your life anything that is not beneficial. That doesn\u2019t just mean possessions, it means people too."}, {"text": "Generally speaking you don\u2019t like taking orders but the current cosmic picture demands that you follow what someone higher up the professional ladder says you should be doing. The most important thing by far now is that you stay in their good books."}, {"text": "Who do you trust? How do you know you can trust them? These will be the kind of questions you will be asking yourself this weekend, and there may be no easy answers. All you can really do is stay alert and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 trust yourself."}, {"text": "You have never been scared of taking on the powers that be, and that\u2019s good, but you really must choose your battles carefully over the coming year. Better still, don\u2019t get involved in any battles at all. Co-operation is always possible if you strive for it hard enough."}, {"text": "You can at times be too assertive, even aggressive, for your own good and the planets warn if you go too far today you could annoy people who have the power to hit back at you in ways that hurt. Tone down your act Aries, at least for now."}, {"text": "You can watch the world go by if you like but would it not be more productive, and more fun, to get involved and make things happen? Don\u2019t take risks but do make sure that others know you\u2019re up for the challenge."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t shoot the messenger if what you hear is not to your liking. Just because a friend or family member delivers bad news does not mean they want to do so, nor does it mean they are happy about it. Also, it\u2019s not the end of the world."}, {"text": "The sun in the career area of your chart makes you intensely ambitious, but ambition alone won\u2019t get you where you want to go. Forge friendships and alliances with people who can help you climb the ladder of success \u2013 and help you stay at the top."}, {"text": "Your self-control will come under pressure today and you may well arrive at a point where you just have to yell at people who don\u2019t see what you see. Will they see it then? Probably not. Sadly, some people seem to enjoy being willfully ignorant."}, {"text": "You may have the power to force others to do things your way at the moment but that does not mean you have to use that power. Today\u2019s sun-Pluto link warns there could be hidden costs if you push too hard. Lead by example, not by coercion."}, {"text": "Relationships of all kinds are under difficult stars today, so you will need to be careful when dealing with people whose feelings seem more important to them than facts. Make allowances for their inability to reason things through as easily as you do."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Pluto link could do some strange things to the way you choose to look at the world. But the important word here is \u201cchoose\u201d \u2013 because ultimately it is up to you what you decide to believe. Choose to believe that the universe is always on your side."}, {"text": "Try not to let a difference of opinion with someone get out of hand today. You know from long experience how quickly quite minor matters can escalate into major confrontations, so stay calm and refuse to be provoked into any kind of intemperate action."}, {"text": "It may annoy you that someone you depend on is taking their time over a task that should have been completed by now but there\u2019s probably not much you can do about it. Don\u2019t let your frustration show or they may take even more time getting it done."}, {"text": "By all means be friendly over the next few days but be cautious too. The planets warn that someone you think is on your side could in fact by plotting behind your back, so don\u2019t do anything they may be able to use as a weapon against you."}, {"text": "What seems like such a good idea now could end up costing you a lot more money than you expected, so make sure you know what you are doing. Also, be wary of people who preach doom and gloom at every turn. Avoid them completely if possible."}, {"text": "Venus and Jupiter, the two most positive planets, are strong on your birthday this year but there is a danger you will take too many risks or take too much for granted. Yes, you can have the good things in life, but you still need to work for them."}, {"text": "No, people are not talking behind your back. No, the world is not out to get you. There may be one or two individuals who say things about you in a less than friendly way today but no way can they harm you \u2013 so stop worrying!"}, {"text": "Your confidence is high at the moment, not least because a friend or family member has made it clear just how much you mean to them. It\u2019s nice to be appreciated. It\u2019s even nicer to be loved. And you are both appreciated AND loved."}, {"text": "The more you worry about something the more power you give it to disrupt your life, so make a conscious decision to put it out of your mind and never think about it again. By far the best way to deal with your fears is to ignore them."}, {"text": "Usually you prefer to keep your feelings to yourself but with Venus at odds with Jupiter, planet of excess, today that may not be possible. If you do go over the top emotionally don\u2019t get too embarrassed about it. It won\u2019t be the last time!"}, {"text": "It seems like everything you touch at the moment turns, if not to gold, then at least to something very good. And with the sun moving in your favour toward the end of this week you have even better days to look forward to. Lucky you!"}, {"text": "Romance is very much in the air at the moment, but you need to be careful. With Jupiter, planet of exaggeration, linked with Venus, planet of love, as the new week begins there is a danger you could read too much into one particular relationship."}, {"text": "If you intend to make changes to your work schedule over the next few days you are advised to let your colleagues know what you are doing well before you actually do it. They have a stake in what you are doing too, so be smart and keep them informed."}, {"text": "Social activities are under favourable stars at the moment, so don\u2019t be afraid to get out into the world and make new friends. You may not be the most open and outgoing member of the zodiac but you have your moments \u2013 make this one of them."}, {"text": "Good news of one kind or another will come your way today and it\u2019s likely you will be on the move either this evening or early tomorrow. Make sure you plan your route well in advance. And have a fallback plan ready, just in case there\u2019s a hold-up."}, {"text": "Whatever duties and obligations you have as the new week begins you don\u2019t have to get on to them immediately. In fact the planets indicate that, as the full moon approaches, it might be a wise move to postpone them for a few days, or even a week."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let fear of failure hold you back from doing what your instincts tell you is right and proper. And certainly don\u2019t let the thought that other people might not approve of your actions slow you down in any way. Stay true to your beliefs."}, {"text": "Make the most of Venus in your sign to build bridges with people you have not been on good terms with of late. Don\u2019t let your ego stop you from making the first approach \u2013 let them know you hold no grudges and want to be friends again."}, {"text": "You will need to develop a thick skin over the coming year as a number of people seem determined to criticize your every move. Maybe they are right, maybe you are doing it wrong, but if you do it with belief it will still work out well for you."}, {"text": "Play by the rules today or you will leave yourself open to accusations that you only do what you want to do when it suits you to do it. A little bit of selfishness is no bad thing but too much could lose you friends faster than you expected."}, {"text": "Be a bit more daring today, especially with money and material objectives. According to the planets you are close to success but you need to break through the mental barrier that keeps you from taking the occasional risk. You can\u2019t play it safe all the time."}, {"text": "Think only of the future and don\u2019t let yesterday\u2019s failures and disappointments hold you back. It\u2019s no big deal that you made mistakes \u2013 everyone does \u2013 and if you find ways to learn from them they could actually make tomorrow\u2019s successes even greater."}, {"text": "Make things happen over the next few days. The planets indicate that if you have confidence in your own abilities and are willing to let the universe guide you then you cannot help but accomplish great things. Fame and fortune are yours for the asking."}, {"text": "If you need to get on the good side of someone in a position of power now is the time. Let them know you are ready to move up in the world and make sure you are ready to act quickly and decisively when they give you your chance."}, {"text": "Do you meet a challenge head-on or you do you hide and wait for it to go away? It may be that the latter proposition looks more attractive to you at the moment but you can and you must be more dynamic. Life is what you make of it."}, {"text": "You have set your sights on a goal and won\u2019t rest until you have reached it, but with a full moon in your sign later this week you need to be quick. Do what has to be done now, this very moment. Stop thinking about it and just act."}, {"text": "Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself over the next 24 hours because the planets warn it\u2019s unlikely you will get a sympathetic hearing, not even from family and friends. The less they know about what motivates you the better \u2013 for now."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t usually let criticism get to you but you seem a bit touchy at the moment and if someone says something a bit negative about you today chances are you will snap back at them. Good. You may not be perfect but you\u2019re better than they are."}, {"text": "You are closer to making a success of something than you appear to realize and if you push yourself just a little bit harder today it should all come together. Just because you cannot yet see the bigger picture does not mean it does not exist."}, {"text": "With Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you are sure to accomplish something significant over the next few days. Try to make it something that benefits other people as well as yourself."}, {"text": "If you spend too long weighing up the pros and cons of a certain course of action you may find that the decision has been taken out of your hands. Follow your instincts and believe that the universe will both guide and protect you."}, {"text": "As Mercury moves into your sign on your birthday the link between your brain and your vocal chords will shorten considerably. Try to think about what you are going to say before you actually say it. Failing that, be prepared to say \u201csorry\u201d often!"}, {"text": "You are who you are and there is no point trying to be someone different. In fact, as first Mercury, today, then Venus, later in the week, move into your birth sign you must at all times and in all situations be true to your own nature."}, {"text": "You may prefer to do things in the open where everyone can see what you are up to but the planets urge you to be a bit more secretive today. Do other people actually need to see what you are doing? If not, keep it to yourself."}, {"text": "You will find it easier to put thoughts into words now that Mercury, your ruling planet, is moving in your favouur again. Don\u2019t worry that what you say might seem outrageous to some people \u2013 it\u2019s their fault for having such tiny minds."}, {"text": "At some stage today it will occur to you that there is an easier way to deal with a problem of a personal nature. Most likely that way is simply to ignore it. If you refuse to focus on it chances are it will lose most of its power."}, {"text": "You may have to put certain plans on hold in the run-up to Friday\u2019s full moon but after that you will be free to push ahead again \u2013 and this time you\u2019ll have the wind at your back. The future is bright Leo, so keep faith and keep working hard."}, {"text": "You are about to discover that someone you thought you could trust has been leading you on in ways that are designed to make failure more likely. You should have noticed before but, as they say, better late than never. So, what are you going to do about it?"}, {"text": "A mental block of some kind will start to crumble over the next few days and come the weekend you will see both where you have been going wrong and what you now need to do to get back on track. After that, it\u2019s up to you."}, {"text": "A work-related issue should seem less of a problem now that mind planet Mercury is moving into the area of your chart that governs, among other things, your mental ability. Chances are you have overlooked a minor, yet rather important, detail."}, {"text": "The planets are beginning to move in your favour and by this time next week your confidence will be sky high again. Between now and then try letting go of any negative feelings you have about other people \u2013 then you can leave them behind too."}, {"text": "A situation you once feared no longer holds any terrors for you and most likely you will seek it out over the next few days, just to prove to yourself that it no longer controls you. If you can, find time to help others with their fears as well."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you have found it hard to express yourself clearly in recent weeks because communications planet Mercury moves in your favour today and soon the words will be flowing again. Don\u2019t say too much though. Some things are best kept to yourself."}, {"text": "The cosmic picture is about to change and in a matter of days you will no longer be under the kind of scrutiny you are now. No doubt you will be relieved but don\u2019t think it means you can hide yourself away again. It\u2019s too late \u2013 you\u2019ve been noticed!"}, {"text": "If you\u2019ve got talent \u2013 and according to your solar chart you have far more than most people \u2013 then you need to shout about it. The fact is you are here for a purpose and have a duty to make the most of your creativity, because the world needs it."}, {"text": "You need to get back in the good books of someone you clashed with recently and you need to be quick about it. Tomorrow\u2019s full moon warns that if you don\u2019t make your peace with them now it may not be possible at all. Say sorry \u2013 it won\u2019t hurt!"}, {"text": "Pace yourself carefully today because if you go too fast you could end up in an untidy heap. Although you may not be able to see them yet there are a number of obstacles in your path that will trip you up if you rush ahead blindly."}, {"text": "Why focus on the things that have gone wrong in your life when there are many more things that have gone right? You seem to be in one of those perverse moods where you actually enjoy being negative about yourself. Get past it!"}, {"text": "The approaching full moon means you may have to apologize for something you said or did that a loved one took the wrong way. Yes, maybe they should have a better sense of humour, but you should know by now what is likely to annoy them."}, {"text": "You may want to be on the move now but certain people will demand that you stay right where you are. The planets warn if you ignore them and push ahead regardless you could damage friendships it will take a long time to heal."}, {"text": "You can\u2019t just forget about what you have to do. There are certain tasks that need to be completed and, like it or not, you will have to get on with them over the next few days. Don\u2019t be half-hearted about it. Aim for excellence as always."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have a crush on someone and are thinking seriously about being honest about your feelings. Is that really such a good idea? The approaching full moon warns that your hopes could be dashed if you speak up too soon."}, {"text": "Try to be a bit more understanding today, especially when dealing with people who are down on their luck or who don\u2019t share your confident outlook on life. Merely telling them to get their act together is unlikely to help very much."}, {"text": "Forget about details now and focus on the wider picture. Leave the small stuff for the kind of small-minded people who seem to enjoy losing themselves in meaningless detail. Your big brain needs something deeper and wider to challenge it."}, {"text": "If you say the right thing in the right tone of voice today then you will undoubtedly get what it is you desire. The only problem is that what you desire may not be good for you. On this occasion it might be better to say nothing at all."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try to force your ideas on other people, because even if you are successful in the short-term you will create so much resentment that eventually they turn against you. If you cannot persuade them with logic, maybe it\u2019s you who has got it wrong."}, {"text": "Once again you are worrying about issues that are not worth the time or the energy. Take a few minutes out of your busy schedule to breathe deeply and clear your mind of troubled thoughts. Fear is a luxury you can do without."}, {"text": "There will always be some people you like and some people you can\u2019t stand the sight of, and if you can recognize and accept that fact the coming year should be a good one, not least because you won\u2019t be inclined to waste time on the latter."}, {"text": "This is probably not the best time to make a far-reaching decision about an important relationship. The full moon warns you should hold off for a few days to see how things develop. In the end you may have to make no decision at all."}, {"text": "Try not to take what happens today too seriously. If someone you live or work with gives you a hard time just let it go and chances are the situation will eventually fizzle out. The only importance it has is the importance you choose to give it."}, {"text": "You may think you can handle a situation on your own but the planets warn you are going to need assistance. Why even think of tackling it alone when you have friends you can turn to for help? Be smart and ask for their advice."}, {"text": "You may not be comfortable with some of the feelings that seem to have taken you over of late but that\u2019s a sign you need to deal with them. Full moons always bring emotions to the surface \u2013 you cannot hide from what you feel forever."}, {"text": "Keep what happens today in perspective. The full moon could bring a nasty shock or three but if you stand back and look at what happens from a wider viewpoint you will realize that it\u2019s not worth getting worked up about. Stay calm."}, {"text": "Try not to be too suspicious over the next two or three days. It may seem as if someone is trying to get rich at your expense but are they really or is it your own overactive imagination leading you on? It\u2019s almost certainly the latter."}, {"text": "No matter what setbacks you may now be encountering you must not lose faith in yourself or in what you are doing. The full moon in your sign may make you doubt that you have what it takes but it is only a passing influence. Stick at it!"}, {"text": "You are in one of those typically Scorpio moods where you seem to believe that the whole world is against you. Not only is it not true but by thinking that way you limit your options. Reach out to people today, don\u2019t push them away."}, {"text": "Why are you worrying what other people might say about what you are doing? Since when have their opinions meant so much to you? Keep moving in the direction that seems right to you and ignore those who pull disapproving faces."}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s full moon takes place in the career area of your chart you can probably sense that you need to tread carefully when dealing with people in positions of power. They could be a bit touchy at the moment, so keep your distance."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try too hard to make people around you smile today because your attempts at humor will most likely fall flat. It\u2019s not because you are no longer funny, it\u2019s because everyone is a bit on edge right now. Give them time \u2013 they\u2019ll get over it."}, {"text": "You must not be half-hearted about what you are expected to do today. Even if you would rather be doing something else you must give it your full attention and total effort. Why? Because you are being watched and assessed. Make a good impression."}, {"text": "You cannot deny your desires and if you try they will only grow stronger. That is the message of your birthday chart this year and what it means is you need to find a positive outlet for your passions. Look for more creative ways to express yourself."}, {"text": "Money matters will be high on your agenda this weekend and that\u2019s good because you need to find ways to boost your cash flow. If you want to get out of debt now is the time to start doing the smart things that can make it happen."}, {"text": "There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot impress now that the sun is moving into your sign. Life will bring opportunities aplenty, so set your sights on your No. 1 goal and let no one tell you that you are aiming too high."}, {"text": "You will accomplish more in the long term if you co-operate with people you work and do business with. Life is not a zero-sum game \u2013 one side does not have to lose so the other side can win. Bear that in mind at all times."}, {"text": "Your sixth sense should be telling you that something is amiss, that while on the surface everything seems calm, deep down some rather scary passions are beginning to stir. But scary for who? Maybe it\u2019s time you engineered a few changes."}, {"text": "The sooner you accept the fact that ambition is not something to be ashamed of the sooner you will find yourself in a position where you are able to make things happen, both for yourself and for other people. Never feel guilty about your desires. "}, {"text": "Yes, of course you are entitled to your opinions, just like everyone else, but the value of those opinions depends on the facts on which they are based. Don\u2019t be afraid of changing the way you look at the world if new information makes it necessary."}, {"text": "You want to prove yourself but that is not an excuse to make trouble. As the sun moves out of your opposite sign today you may be tempted to say and do things just to get a reaction, but it may not be the sort of reaction you expected."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need to take control of each and every situation. In fact the planets suggest quite strongly that if you let others make all the decisions today you will come out of it very well indeed. And if things do go wrong, it won\u2019t be your fault!"}, {"text": "The planets warn if you push yourself too hard now you will pay for it later on, so slow things down and try to get into a smooth and easy groove, especially on the work front where you cannot possibly do it all on your own."}, {"text": "You have so much to be thankful for and so much to look forward to, so why the long face? As the sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend it really is time to cheer up and start making plans \u2013 the bigger the better."}, {"text": "The planets warn if you take on too many things this weekend you will struggle later on when, inevitably, even more chores and responsibilities come your way. Cut back on your commitments and try not to do more than one thing at a time."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let anyone tell you what you should think or how you should feel. If someone tries to poke their nose into your private affairs this weekend make the consequences painful for them. If nothing else it will deter others from trying."}, {"text": "A sun-Saturn link on your birthday will shine a spotlight on your career and it may well be that by this time next year you will be in a completely different line of work. Ask yourself what kind of job would bring you true satisfaction \u2013 then go for it."}, {"text": "A financial setback may have left you with a bit less money in your pocket but is that such a bad thing? You can be a bit of a spendthrift at times, so maybe you should take this as a reminder that cash does not grow on trees."}, {"text": "You may want to get along with everyone you work with but one particular individual is giving you such a hard time that it may not be possible in their case. You need to get tough with them Taurus or the situation will only get worse."}, {"text": "Saturn\u2019s influence should stop you getting carried away by your own magnificence today but other people will still praise you to the skies, and with good reason. Don\u2019t let what they say go to your head or you\u2019ll regret it later in the week."}, {"text": "All things are possible for you now, but even so you still need to take other people\u2019s wishes into account, especially on the work front where you don\u2019t yet hold all the cards. There is more you can do with others than you can do on your own."}, {"text": "If you take a risk over the next 24 hours it could pay off in a big way, but it could just as easily lead to a massive loss, so think before you act and do what you so rarely do \u2013 proceed with caution! It\u2019s really not that hard Leo."}, {"text": "By all means find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts for a while. There is so much chatter in your life at the moment that your senses are suffering from overload. Find ways to escape the chaos and confusion."}, {"text": "If you say one thing in public while believing something different in private you could leave yourself open to charges of hypocrisy, or worse. Don\u2019t tell people what you think they want to hear \u2013 tell them the truth as you see it."}, {"text": "It\u2019s good that you are cautious by nature but today\u2019s sun-Saturn link could make you so careful in what you say and do that you get nothing worthwhile either said or done! Remember, you are a free-born human being, so be free in word and deed."}, {"text": "If a creative project hits a wall today don\u2019t try to force your way past it. Take it as a sign from the cosmos that you need to stand back for a while and give yourself time to think it through. It could be that changes are needed."}, {"text": "You are not the sort to put profit before principle and that\u2019s good because someone will try to tempt you today. Your reputation means more to you than a few extra dollars, so tell them to find someone else to corrupt. Self-respect is everything."}, {"text": "What other people expect of you is of no importance \u2013 the only thing that matters is what you expect of yourself. What you are about to do may make you unpopular with the powers that be but that won\u2019t worry you. It means you are doing something right."}, {"text": "Something you thought would make your life more exciting has begun to lose its lustre, and hopefully that will remind you that just because something is shiny and new does not mean it is valuable or worthwhile. All that glitters is not gold."}, {"text": "Try to be a bit more assertive in one-to-one relationships over the coming year, but at the same time don\u2019t go too far and risk alienating people whose assistance you may need. Get the balance right between promoting yourself and working with others."}, {"text": "ARIES (March 21 - April 20):"}, {"text": "If you are not in a particularly good mood as the new week begins try cheering yourself up by treating yourself to something nice. It does not have to be costly \u2013 there are plenty of fun things you can enjoy that don\u2019t cost a cent."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Uranus link in your sign means you are not in the mood to focus on mundane and tedious things, you need something that excites you. Let other people take care of the small stuff, especially on the work front, as you indulge your passions."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t wait for others to give you permission to do things, just do them and accept that it will make a few waves. Since when have you been the sort who cares to any great extent what other people think? Be bold. Be brave. Be a true Gemini!"}, {"text": "You may be reserved by nature but you have your moments of inspiration and if the planets are to be believed you may have several such moments today. Don\u2019t try to ignore the passions that are raging inside you, let them all out to play."}, {"text": "Both in your personal affairs and on the work front you will be the center of attention today, which is exactly where you feel most at home. The sun in the career area of your chart will highlight the positive side of your nature. You were born to lead."}, {"text": "Someone who is as different to you personality-wise as it is possible to get will catch your eye today and it won\u2019t be long before you form a close and enduring relationship. Will it be a romantic one? Stranger things have happened."}, {"text": "You seem to be enjoying more than your fair share of creative ideas at the moment, and that\u2019s great. You do, however, need to be aware that you cannot expect other people to automatically fit in with your plans. They may have very different ideas to you."}, {"text": "You will be on the best of terms with everyone as the new week gets under way, but one particular individual will feel the full force of that legendary Scorpio passion. If you\u2019re not a pair already the planets suggest you very soon will be."}, {"text": "You will need to juggle your commitments over the next few days, not least because you have signed up for too many things. Just make sure that everyone you have made promises to, be they personal or professional, feels they are getting value for money."}, {"text": "You seem to have offended a few people of late, but it\u2019s no big deal. All you have to do is turn on the charm and make them believe that it was all a misunderstanding. You\u2019ll get away with it this time, but next time watch what you say."}, {"text": "You must not allow yourself to get annoyed because once your temper starts to fray it will unravel quicker than you expected. Uranus, your ruler, warns that family-related issues could be especially challenging, so treat partners and loved ones with respect."}, {"text": "Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours because your words may not sound as wonderful to other people as they do to you. Try to remember that not everyone shares your rather zany sense of humor. Some people have very literal minds."}, {"text": "Sometimes you can be a bit too eager to help other people and end up doing things for them that they really should be doing for themselves. Keep that thought in mind this year. Sometimes the best way to help is to not do so much."}, {"text": "Make the most of Venus, planet of love, in your sign to let partners and relatives know how much they mean to you. You don\u2019t have to make a big thing of your feelings but there is no harm in spelling out for them how much you care."}, {"text": "It will pay you to lower your sights a little today and not expect to be No. 1 in everything you do. You have absolutely nothing to prove, so don\u2019t waste your time and energy trying to look good \u2013 because you already do."}, {"text": "Someone you have always been loyal to may let you down today and, not unnaturally, you won\u2019t be too happy about it. However, it might pay you to find out what really happened \u2013 it\u2019s quite possible it\u2019s just a big misunderstanding.

You will get employers and senior colleagues on your side with ease today."}, {"text": "It\u2019s always a good idea to take a break occasionally and even though the week is just beginning you are strongly advised to take things easy for a bit. You will need all your energy to deal with what happens later in the week."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to be honest about your feelings but you should make the effort anyway as you have a great deal to offer. The problem is you don\u2019t like to risk getting hurt \u2013 but unless you open up to life you won\u2019t ever achieve much."}, {"text": "With Venus, your ruler, moving through the partnership area of your chart you won\u2019t find it difficult to let others know how you feel, and they, in turn, will be a lot more open with you. New friendships will develop and existing friendships will grow even stronger."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t sit there worrying that you may not be able to make ends meet or that your work no longer interests you \u2013 get out into the world and find reasons to be cheerful. Once you are on the move your problems are sure to disappear."}, {"text": "Stop pretending that you are happy with what\u2019s going on and let everyone know how you feel. Even if you go over the top a bit \u2013 and you will \u2013 the fact that you are willing to speak up means that others will start taking you more seriously."}, {"text": "A friend will need a shoulder to cry on today and you will do everything in your power to console them. However, once you have got them calmed down you must then make it clear to them that they need to toughen up. Tears solve nothing."}, {"text": "You are in a sociable mood at the moment and that\u2019s good because the more people you interact with the more likely it is you will discover new opportunities, both on a personal level and in your career. The world thinks you\u2019re special \u2013 and you are."}, {"text": "As life is likely to get a bit hectic later in the week you are advised to take things easy while you can.

Be kind to yourself."}, {"text": "Power relationships of one sort or another will play a large part in your life over the coming year and it\u2019s quite likely that your own position will change dramatically. No matter what happens, be it good or bad, never forget that you are captain of your soul."}, {"text": "Resist the temptation to live too much of your life in the past. It\u2019s okay to look back now and again but if you keep doing it then something is wrong. Aries is supposed to be a go-ahead sign, so get going and start creating your tomorrows today."}, {"text": "People you meet while out and about today could be less than helpful, so try not to get yourself in situations where you have to rely on the generosity of strangers. In fact, for best results you should stick as close to home as you can."}, {"text": "According to the planets you are aiming too low and the reason for that is your fears have started to get the better of you. That\u2019s a shame because the planets indicate if you raise your sights a bit you could accomplish something amazing quite soon."}, {"text": "You\u2019ve hardly had time to draw breath of late and it\u2019s unlikely that will change over the next few days. What will change though is that a relationship will go into a kind of limbo for a while.

But don\u2019t start thinking that\u2019s the end of the matter. You should know by now that causes always have consequences."}, {"text": "You have the power to make far-reaching changes, but because Pluto begins one of its rare retrograde phases today it might be wise not to make too much of it. The best changes are the ones that come from evolution, not revolution."}, {"text": "You need to get your head around the fact that change is inevitable, and once you have managed that you will realize that worrying about change is a waste of time. Instead of trying to avoid what is changing, try using it to improve your position."}, {"text": "There is nothing you cannot do, nothing you cannot accomplish. Even though your ruling planet Pluto is now beginning its retrograde phase you still have the power to make things happen, simply by trusting your instincts and acting on them."}, {"text": "The world around you may seem chaotic at the moment but if you stand back and try to see the bigger picture today you will recognize the outlines of a design that has always been there. Your life still has, and will always have, meaning and purpose."}, {"text": "People are what they are and you won\u2019t change them by wishing they were more like you. What happens today will not only remind you of that fact but also highlight what a boring world it would be if each and every one of us were the same."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have been pushing yourself too hard and need a rest. And not just a physical rest but a mental and emotional one too. There is only so much sensory input an Aquarius can take and you are now way past your limit."}, {"text": "Something dramatic will happen over the next 24 hours and while it may not be possible to say exactly what that something might be it will certainly be linked to friendships and group activities. Looks like Pisces will have to come to the rescue again!"}, {"text": "If you are planning something big \u2013 and according to your birthday chart you are \u2013 then you need to go about it in an organized and logical way. Look ahead to how you would like things to be a year from now, then start moving step by step in that direction."}, {"text": "Avoid extremes today, both in your personal life and, in particular, at work. Tread especially carefully when dealing with employers and anyone else who may be in a position to harm your career. Don\u2019t let that mouth of yours get you into trouble!"}, {"text": "You know that something is wrong but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on what it might be. Stop fretting about it and focus on the task that is in front of you right now. The answer will come when your mind is busy on other things."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you will take too much for granted and end up feeling disappointed when something doesn\u2019t work out the way you thought it would. Also, if you come into money over the next few days save it, don\u2019t spend it."}, {"text": "Someone who does not share your outlook on life will give you a hard time today, Just ignore it. Keep having fun and make sure they can see you are having fun. Annoying them with your enjoyment of life will be a lot of fun in itself."}, {"text": "You must not give up on something just because it is harder to master than you thought it would be. On the work front especially it will be tempting to act as if something is no longer worth your time and energy, but it is, so keep at it."}, {"text": "Try not to be too pushy today. The planets warn if you attempt to impose your will on other people they will react in ways that make life difficult for you. You don\u2019t have to make demands to get others to follow you \u2013 just lead by example."}, {"text": "The more you do for someone the more they seem to expect of you, so you need to call a halt and let them know that from here on in they are on their own. That may sound unkind but they will benefit from it in the long-term."}, {"text": "Your thoughts create your world \u2013 what you think today will be your reality tomorrow \u2013 so it is of the utmost importance that you control what goes on in your mind. Strive to be positive at all times and in all situations. Above all, keep smiling."}, {"text": "Under no circumstances should you make claims you don\u2019t actually know to be true. Inevitably, those claims will be challenged and if you cannot come up with the facts and figures to back them up it could be highly embarrassing."}, {"text": "The moon\u2019s eclipse of Saturn in your sign means your emotions will be all over the place today. One minute you\u2019ll be on the highest of highs and the next you\u2019ll be on the lowest of lows. There\u2019s not much you can do except ride it out."}, {"text": "You need to quit worrying about things over which you have no control. It may be that something has not gone in your favor but it\u2019s no big deal in the greater scheme of things. Lighten up, it\u2019s life. You can still find ways to have fun."}, {"text": "If someone starts laying down the law and demanding that you do things their way, your best course of action is to remove yourself from their presence. You don\u2019t have to put up with their annoying behaviour. You don\u2019t have to do anything."}, {"text": "If the pace of life seems a bit slow at the moment don\u2019t worry, it will pick up considerably over the next 12 months. There may even be times when it gets too much and you wish it were slow and boring again. But not for long!"}, {"text": "You should know better than to provoke someone whose power is more than a match for your own, but if you don\u2019t then expect life to be tougher than it need have been today. Be smart and do whatever it takes to stay out of their way."}, {"text": "You can give your reputation a much-needed boost today by doing what needs to be done without being asked or instructed. Get your act together and make sure those above you on the professional ladder know who you are and what you can do."}, {"text": "You may not be able to explain how you have reached a certain conclusion but you know in your bones it is the right one, so be bold and stick with it. Not everyone will agree with you, of course, but don\u2019t let that worry you."}, {"text": "Whatever negative situation you find yourself in today you can be sure that help will arrive when you need it the most, so don\u2019t panic. Believe it or not you are being watched over by cosmic powers that won\u2019t let you come to any great harm."}, {"text": "Think back to what occurred around the start of the week. Most likely you were given the opportunity to do something out of the ordinary but did not follow up on it. You are about to be given a second chance. This time you must act."}, {"text": "Methods and routines you have relied on for years need to be replaced \u2013 not tomorrow or the day after but right this very minute. You know what they are and you know why they need to go, so what are you waiting for? Get on with it."}, {"text": "Avoid arguing with people whose outlook on life differs radically from your own. Your views are so far apart that a compromise of any kind is highly unlikely. It\u2019s no big deal though. The world would be a boring place if we all agreed."}, {"text": "You need to resolve any outstanding differences of opinion you may have with the people you work with. If you allow them to carry on into the weekend you could find that your social and travel plans are affected in negative ways."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t have to open your mouth to let others know how you feel today \u2013 the look on your face will be more than enough to inform them that you are not in the least bit pleased. If they have got any sense they will quickly change their ways!"}, {"text": "Focus more on the fun side of life. You can be a bit too serious at times and the planets indicate you will do yourself a lot of good if you forget about money and work for a while and just enjoy what the day brings your way."}, {"text": "This is an excellent time for social activities and if you make an effort to reach out to people, even strangers you meet along the way, you will have a really fun day. It could be a profitable day too as friendships bring financial opportunities."}, {"text": "You are being far too cautious Pisces. You need to get past what you fear and recognize that the universe will always protect you. It\u2019s not the worst that could happen you should be focusing on now but the best. Take a chance on life."}, {"text": "If you are not happy with the direction your life is taking then it\u2019s up to you to pick a new course. On just about every level you will have the power to change things over the coming year, not just for yourself but for those who depend on you too."}, {"text": "You will come alive again over the next few days. That get-up-and-go that got up and went will be back with a vengeance and before you know it you will be cruising along as if there had never been anything holding you back. It\u2019s good to be free."}, {"text": "You need to get past some sort of obstacle or obstruction and with mind planet Mercury moving into your sign today that should not be too much of a problem. Show those who say you are too inflexible to change just how wrong they can be."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you could get too obsessive about something that isn\u2019t really of any great importance. By all means fight for some kind of cause but don\u2019t turn it into a life or death struggle, because it\u2019s really not worth the effort."}, {"text": "You need to be more positive about a relationship. If you let your negative thoughts about it get the upper hand you could actually cause the sort of breakdown you are so desperate to avoid. Thoughts are very real things, and always have consequences."}, {"text": "You would prefer life to be less complicated but the fact is you are where you are and it doesn\u2019t look as if much is going to change for a while. You can though start making plans, the kind of big plans that only a Leo would dare to consider."}, {"text": "You need to make a conscious effort to break free of the mental and emotional bonds you have imposed on yourself. No one can do it for you Virgo, so get your act together and start looking at the events of your life as an opportunity, not a burden."}, {"text": "You will have words today with someone who is about as different to you in outlook as it is possible to get. No matter how robust your exchange of views may be you both have a story to tell, so speak up \u2013 but remember to listen as well."}, {"text": "Like everyone else you are good at some things and not so good at others, and cosmic activity in your opposite sign will not only help you get to grips with that fact but make it possible to get assistance from those who can do things that you can\u2019t."}, {"text": "The most important thing over the next few days is that you don\u2019t let fear hold you back from doing the things you most want to do. Forget about what the neighbours might say and do what feels right to you personally. Nothing else matters."}, {"text": "Someone will try to stop you doing what you enjoy today but it\u2019s up to you whether they succeed or not. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart encourages you to follow your own path \u2013 but there are limits beyond which even you cannot go."}, {"text": "You should find it easier to get your message across about family issues now that Mercury, planet of communication, is moving into the domestic area of your chart. Once loved ones know what you think, encourage them to speak up as well."}, {"text": "You may be somewhat vocal in your opinions today and not everyone will be happy about it, but don\u2019t let that prevent you from speaking your mind. Too many people have been trying to evade the truth for too long a time. Shake things up a bit."}, {"text": "Take a few minutes out from your birthday celebrations to ask yourself what you would most like to accomplish over the coming 12 months. Keep it short and simple and make sure you write it down. A year from now your \u201cwish list\u201d will be a reality."}, {"text": "You are perfectly within your rights to refuse a request if you don\u2019t believe it is the correct thing to do. Even if you owe someone a favor that does not mean you have to give them what they ask for. Your needs must come first \u2013 always."}, {"text": "If you use your imagination this week you can find ways to make the creative side of your nature pay. That may be \u201cpay\u201d in the financial sense, or it may be \u201cpay\u201d in the more general sense of improving your standing in the world at large."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you are becoming too generous with people who don\u2019t really deserve it. You have never expected something for nothing in life so why should you let other people expect it of you? Get rid of the freeloaders Gemini!"}, {"text": "The sun in the friendship area of your chart makes it easy to get along with people you meet socially and in the course of your work. Even if you are quite different in terms of personality you will find things that bring you together."}, {"text": "Generally speaking you don\u2019t like it when others depend on you too much, not least because it limits your own options, but this week you will quite enjoy the fact that someone needs your assistance with something. Show them how it should be done."}, {"text": "You will get through a lot of work this week without working up much of a sweat. If you can clear the backlog of jobs that have built up recently you can start next week with a clear slate \u2013 a very nice feeling indeed."}, {"text": "There may be times this week when you believe that others don\u2019t really mean what they say, but why should that worry you? They can say what they like but there is nothing they can do to force you to act. You\u2019re still your own boss."}, {"text": "Let others make the first move this week, especially if you are hoping to travel together or meet friends in a social situation. Any suggestions you come up with will most likely be rejected, so let them do the thinking and the planning."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t hesitate to help someone who needs assistance this week but you must also make it clear to them that this is a one-off and that you won\u2019t be there for them every time, or even the next time. They need to take responsibility for themselves."}, {"text": "The more you give this week the more you will get in return. Put your competitive instincts on hold for a few days and make it your one and only aim to make other people feel good. It will make you feel good as well."}, {"text": "There is no point taking on someone who is clearly stronger and better connected than you. Admit to yourself that on this occasion the sensible course of action is to back off. Don\u2019t think of it as a defeat, think of it as a strategic retreat."}, {"text": "You like to look confident, but something has been bothering you to such an extent that you are having a hard time keeping up appearances. Let it go. Forget about it. You only give it power because you think about it so much."}, {"text": "Jupiter\u2019s influence on your birthday suggests you will be tempted to throw caution to the wind and do something that has never been done before. Instead, how about doing something you have done before, only to a much higher standard?"}, {"text": "If you have your doubts about a scheme that everyone seems to think is wonderful then you must speak up. Chances are you are not the only one who feels uncomfortable about it, so say what is on your mind and start a much-needed debate."}, {"text": "Do what you feel like doing, not what other people feel you should be doing. Too many times in the past you have gone along with what the crowd demanded because you did not want to rock the boat. Now rock it as hard as you can!"}, {"text": "Like it or not you have to accept that other people are calling the shots at the moment. There is no point sulking about it \u2013 instead, do what they ask of you but in such a way that your needs are met first and foremost."}, {"text": "Go some place different and do something different over the coming week. It\u2019s always easy to hang around the same old haunts and do the same old things but there is an adventurous side to the Cancer nature that for too long has been denied."}, {"text": "The sun, your ruler, makes a difficult link to Jupiter, planet of excess, today, so there is a danger that you will go over the top in some way \u2013 and, yes, you will regret it later on. You cannot control other people but you can control yourself."}, {"text": "Either start something new today or relaunch something that has already been started but, for one reason or another, has been in limbo for quite some time. It\u2019s never too late to pick up on an old plan, especially if it\u2019s a good plan."}, {"text": "You may think that you need to act fast and that if you don\u2019t get the ball rolling right this very minute you will lose out in some way, but it isn\u2019t true. The planets urge you to wait a while and watch how matters develop. Don\u2019t rush."}, {"text": "This is a great day for meeting up with people who share your general outlook on life. Together you will be able to do things that you might not have been able to do on your own. You will accomplish so much \u2013 and have a great deal of fun."}, {"text": "You may be eager to climb the ladder of success but watch out. Today\u2019s sun-Jupiter link warns it may not be as easy as it looks, especially if you are the sort of Sagittarius who rarely plans ahead. Tailor your aims to suit your abilities."}, {"text": "Anything to do with art or other creative activities should go well for you now, but you need to make sure that your imagination is under control. Don\u2019t get carried away with ideas and visions that are so far out they can never come true."}, {"text": "You need to be brutally honest today, both with yourself and with other people. Ask yourself if what you are working on can ever truly be a success. If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d then carry on. But if the answer is \u201cno\u201d then end it right now."}, {"text": "What a friend or family member suggests may sound enticing but the planets warn it won\u2019t be as simple as they make it sound. If you get carried away with \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and other flights of fancy today reality is sure to bring you crashing down."}, {"text": "Travel plans and social arrangements are unlikely to run smoothly over the coming 12 months. What are the planets trying to tell you by this? That you need to stay where you are and sort out personal issues rather than try to run away from them."}, {"text": "As Saturn begins one of its retrograde phases today you would be well advised to hold off making any major decisions, in particular about your career. The only thing you can be certain of is that nothing is for certain, at least for now."}, {"text": "The answer to a problem that has been nagging at you for weeks will pop into your head at some point today and no doubt you will be delighted. Be careful though. The planets warn there could be more than a bit of wishful thinking involved."}, {"text": "Sometimes the best way to deal with a troublesome issue is to pretend it does not exist, and if you do that today then the rest of the week should be worry free. You will, of course, have to deal with it eventually but don\u2019t think of that now."}, {"text": "Do whatever it takes to stay on good terms with the people around you today because if you fall out in any way it could be difficult making up with them again, especially if they are as stubborn as you! Don\u2019t let petty issues divide you."}, {"text": "You may not believe in miracles as such but there have been a number of strange coincidences of late that make you wonder if you are being watched over by a higher power. Someone \u2013 or \u201csomething\u201d \u2013 up there definitely likes you Leo!"}, {"text": "You will rediscover your enthusiasm for a plan or project that faded in importance a while back, which is good, but you must not let it take up all of your time. Do you really need to revisit it, or is it just a way to avoid something else?"}, {"text": "No one can force you to do things against your will but you are certainly open to persuasion. Someone who knows how your mind works will make the right noises today but you must check that what they tell you is true. What are the facts?"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t even think that you can solve a problem by running away from it. That may have been possible in the past but it isn\u2019t possible now, so face up to what seems to be going wrong and find ways to put it right. Use your imagination."}, {"text": "According to the planets you are either a lot richer or a lot poorer than you thought and with luck it will be the former, but if it isn\u2019t you will have to adjust your spending habits. Do you really need to possess so many luxury items?"}, {"text": "Saturn, your ruler, begins its retrograde phase today, so something that has been moving along quite smoothly may come to an unexpected stop. Take that as a sign you need to look at what you are doing more closely. Could you be doing it some other way?"}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to stand there and take it while other people criticize you but you may have to do just that today. The fact is they have a point, if not several, and you need to accept that fact, learn from it, and make changes."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t hesitate to speak your mind over the coming year and for the most part what you have to say will be treated with respect. Make sure everything you say is uplifting in some way, even on the rare occasion when you find it necessary to be critical."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be much in the mood for work today and there really is no point doing things you have no interest in. Give yourself permission to take life at a slow and easy pace and let others do the heavy lifting. You owe yourself a break."}, {"text": "The new moon will do wonders for your confidence this coming weekend but between now and then you are advised not to challenge yourself to any great extent. Save yourself, mentally and physically, for when your efforts will be most effective."}, {"text": "Someone will make out they have been hard done by today but you must have none of it. If they\u2019ve had problems it\u2019s because they ignored your advice and pushed ahead with something you knew would not work. It\u2019s their fault if it hurts."}, {"text": "You must not let people you live or work with tie you down to promises and timetables today. Be vague about where you are going and what you are doing so they can\u2019t back you into a corner from which you have no escape."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication, is well placed in your chart at the moment but it is also at odds with Saturn, planet of authority \u2013 a clear cosmic warning to steer clear of arguments with people in positions of power. Why? Because you will lose."}, {"text": "You may want to make a good impression but that is not an excuse, still less an invitation, to cut corners and break rules. Just be who you are and do what you do best and that should be enough to get you noticed for the right reasons."}, {"text": "The planets warn you could be \u201cseeing\u201d things that do not exist outside the confines of your own overactive imagination. Try to stand outside yourself and observe what\u2019s going on from a neutral position. Most likely nothing bad is happening at all."}, {"text": "A friend or family member will say something today that surprises you, not least because it never occurred to you that they might see things that way. Maybe it\u2019s your fault for having too narrow a focus. Try recognizing that it\u2019s not all about you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be surprised if some of the people you deal with today are a bit evasive in their answers. It doesn\u2019t mean they have done something wrong, it means they don\u2019t like you probing them about their personal affairs. Which is perfectly fair."}, {"text": "You should know by now that if you try to solve the same type of problem with the same type of solution you will fail in the same way as you did before. You need to up your game Capricorn, and that means finding new ways to win."}, {"text": "The more cold water a critic pours on your plans today the more determined you must be to stick with them. The fact that they are being so negative suggests they are seriously worried that you will show them up. And they\u2019re right, you will."}, {"text": "You seem to be in two minds at the moment about how best to make use of your time and your energy. What you eventually choose to do is of less importance than that you actually make a decision and stick to it. Focus is essential."}, {"text": "Something you feel strongly about will be challenged over the next few months and you will need to react in a way that shows you won\u2019t be silenced or denied. You have something important to say and you have every right to be heard."}, {"text": "As Mercury in your sign squares up to power planet Pluto today you will find that in some areas you are able to set the agenda but in other areas you can only react to events. Either way you will have plenty to do, so be prepared!"}, {"text": "The most important thing today is that you avoid wishful thinking, because you will most likely be disappointed if you expect fantastic things to occur. Make sure your aims are well-defined and make sure you know what you are talking about."}, {"text": "What you discover over the next 24 hours may be unsettling but it will also make you aware that some of the things you profess to believe in may not be as cut and dried as you thought. Try not to be quite so rigid in your thinking."}, {"text": "Before you make any sort of offer, to friends or business partners or people in positions of authority, you must make sure you can deliver. Pluto in your opposite sign warns that others won\u2019t be amused if what you say falls short of what you can do."}, {"text": "It seems that someone has taken a shine to you and will do whatever it is you ask of them. That may set your mind, and your pulse, racing but don\u2019t go over the top. You\u2019ll stay in their good books longer if you don\u2019t ask for the world."}, {"text": "Mercury, your ruler, is under a fair bit of cosmic pressure at the moment, so be on your guard and don\u2019t be surprised if someone you thought was on your side goes over to the opposition. It\u2019s nothing personal \u2013 everyone is a bit mixed up at the moment."}, {"text": "The more someone tries to persuade you to do things their way the more you should ask yourself what\u2019s in it for them. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Aries means others are sure to put their own needs first. Be aware of that fact."}, {"text": "You have no option but to knuckle down and complete what you started. There may be a dozen more interesting things you would rather be doing but the fact is there is one, and only one, thing that must be done. Do it now and do it right."}, {"text": "If you are planning to start something new over the next few days then you need to plan it in as much detail as possible. Saturday\u2019s new moon will help you but it will go better if you are clear in your mind what it is you are after."}, {"text": "Other people will make all kinds of demands on you over the next few days and you won\u2019t want to disappoint them. That\u2019s good. If you assist them now you will be in a much stronger position to make a few demands of your own later on."}, {"text": "Your powers of persuasion may be formidable but with communications planet Mercury under a fair bit of pressure at the moment even you will find it hard to get your own way. Just accept that some people will never share your ideals."}, {"text": "Although you may receive good news concerning a money matter today you are still not out of the financial woods, so don\u2019t take it as an excuse to go on a spree. If anything you need to be selling the things you don\u2019t need, not buying more."}, {"text": "Go your own way and do your own thing over the coming year \u2013 and if certain individuals don\u2019t like it then do it some more! You have done some good things for other people over the past 12 months or so \u2013 now do something good for yourself."}, {"text": "If you have been thinking about taking a risk of some kind then do so today. With luck planet Jupiter firmly on your side you will probably win, but even if you lose it\u2019s unlikely the consequences will be too bad. It\u2019s really not much of a gamble."}, {"text": "Not only is the sun moving through your birth sign but with a new moon approaching as well you stand an excellent chance of success, whatever it is you choose to do. With that fact in mind why not choose to do something spectacular?"}, {"text": "Go out of your way to help someone in need. The planets suggest that if you show your generous side over the next 24 hours the universe will be generous to you in the very near future \u2013 not that you will be looking for reward, of course."}, {"text": "The planets suggest this is one of those rare occasions when you can say what you please and get away with it. Today\u2019s Mercury-Jupiter link is especially good for work-related matters, so speak up if you think the powers that be are doing it wrong."}, {"text": "If you honestly believe that you should be getting more in the way of rewards and applause then now is the time to press your claim. Important people are very much on your side at the moment, so make sure they know what you\u2019ve been up to."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to follow what your instincts tell you to do. Today\u2019s Mercury-Jupiter link and tomorrow\u2019s new moon will encourage you to be bold in thought, word and deed. Go for it Virgo \u2013 and you are sure to get it."}, {"text": "You like to be generous but there are times when you go too far, give too much away, and give others the idea that you will always be there for them. You know that isn\u2019t possible, so stop promising what you may not be able to deliver."}, {"text": "Before you go charging to someone\u2019s rescue today make sure they want to be rescued. It could be the case that they are not in any great trouble at all, which could be embarrassing for you when your gallant entry is met with looks of disbelief."}, {"text": "You are in a forceful mood and unlikely to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer, but you need to be aware that your overbearing attitude could rub certain people the wrong way. Worse, they could be the very people whose support you are going to need."}, {"text": "The next two or three days should be good for you. Whatever you may have achieved in the past you can achieve something even better now, so aim high, believe you can make a difference, and get out there and engage with the world."}, {"text": "Highly positive cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart promises that good things will happen over the next two or three days if you reach out to the people you love. Forget about past differences \u2013 it\u2019s what unites you now that matters."}, {"text": "If you have something to say then speak up and make sure you get heard. Too often in the past you were a bit too timid and your voice was drowned out by noisier individuals. Your message is too important to be overlooked \u2013 so start shouting!"}, {"text": "A new moon on your birthday spells success. It\u2019s that simple. Decide what it is you most want from life, then get out into the world and make it happen. Your head and your heart are in perfect alignment, and the universe is very much on your side."}, {"text": "If you start something new this weekend you must make sure you can afford to see it through to the end. If money is tight you might like to consider other options that don\u2019t cost so much. You can do just as much on a smaller budget."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon will encourage you to pull out the stops and really go for it. Others may say you are going to extremes, and maybe you are, but it won\u2019t worry you in the slightest. As far as you are concerned it\u2019s about having fun."}, {"text": "There is something you need to deal with and you need to deal with it now, immediately, this very moment. You may have avoided the issue a number of times in the past but you cannot avoid it today, so get your act together and get on with it."}, {"text": "Chances are you will say something today that causes a bit of an uproar, but the fact is it needs to be said and it needs to be you who is doing the saying. There is only one thing worse than censorship and that is self-censorship."}, {"text": "Even if you are one of those rare Leos who like to keep a low profile you will be putting yourself about this weekend and letting important people know who you are and what you can do. The new moon is sure to bring new opportunities."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to be so outspoken but you have something to say and you intend to make sure your voice gets heard. You won\u2019t care in the slightest that some people might be hurt by your words \u2013 as far as you are concerned only the truth matters."}, {"text": "Take a bit more notice of what is going on in the world around you. You can learn a lot from what other people say and do, and from the mistakes they make, and the more you learn now the more you will prosper in the near future."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon will throw up some interesting possibilities and perhaps the most interesting of them all will be a new friendship. You will form an instant bond with someone who, while different in many ways, complements your Scorpio nature."}, {"text": "If there is a task you have been ignoring in the hope that someone else might do it for you then, sadly, you are out of luck. The cosmic powers that be will insist that you see it through to the end \u2013 so you may as well get started!"}, {"text": "Most things are coming easily to you now but that is not an excuse to take your foot off the gas and coast at a comfortable speed. At this time of year more than most you have the potential to accomplish something remarkable, so push yourself harder."}, {"text": "If you need to resolve a crisis of some kind now is the time to get people together and discuss what needs to be done. You must though keep your personal feelings out of it. A logical and fair-minded approach is not an option but a must."}, {"text": "It\u2019s unlikely you will be able to focus to any great extent on everyday chores, not when there are so many wonderful things going on in your world. Socially this is one of the best weekends of the year for having fun. So go for it!"}, {"text": "A Mars-Pluto link on your birthday means you are determined to make something of yourself in the wider world. To get where you most want to go you will have to be ruthless with yourself. But be kind to other people \u2013 it\u2019s always good politics."}, {"text": "What you need to remember today is that while talent is a good thing to have nothing beats commitment. You\u2019ve got what it takes \u2013 of that there is no doubt \u2013 but do you have the staying power to see what you are doing through to success?"}, {"text": "Others can get involved in plots and schemes if they want to but you know it\u2019s best to steer clear of that kind of thing. If you don\u2019t, the upcoming full moon will find ways to remind you to mind your own business, not other people\u2019s."}, {"text": "The planets urge you to finish what you started before taking on anything new. No matter how desperate you may be to make a good impression the most important thing is to get on top of your workload while you have the chance. That means right now."}, {"text": "Focus your energies in a single direction over the next 24 hours. If others try to get you to do more just refuse. The planets warn it will be all too easy to waste time on non-essentials, so list your priorities and then tick them off one by one."}, {"text": "If you find yourself getting into an argument with someone who is clearly better informed than you then find a way out of it before you make a fool of yourself. You may have strong convictions but how will they hold up when confronted by facts?"}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to give in to intimidation and that\u2019s good because as the full moon draws closer you may find that some people start throwing their weight around. Let them say what they want to say, then just smile and walk away."}, {"text": "If you come on too strong or make too many complaints over the next two or three days you could turn important people against you, which in turn could damage your earning power. Yes, they may be a pain, but learn to put up with them."}, {"text": "Something that starts out simple could develop into something a lot more complicated today, so keep a cool head and, most importantly of all, keep your eyes and ears open. You may find yourself having to help people who are not as clued in as you."}, {"text": "You may be able to see the funny side of what\u2019s going on but not everyone shares your offbeat sense of humour, so don\u2019t be surprised if you get some less than positive looks when you laugh out loud. Some people just can\u2019t take a joke."}, {"text": "You must not let your emotions get the better of you today, because once you start down that route you may not be able to turn back. No matter how upsetting a scene may be you must force yourself to look at it in a dispassionate and logical way."}, {"text": "Give yourself a break Aquarius. You don\u2019t have to be on the go all the time. Stand back from the chaos that is taking place all around you and just be a spectator for a while. If nothing else you\u2019ll get a better sense of perspective than most people."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that your past will catch up with you over the next few days but the good news is it won\u2019t cause you too much embarrassment. Friends and loved ones have far more important things to worry about than your minor indiscretions."}, {"text": "No matter how emotional or irrational certain people may get over the coming year you must stay calm at all times and in all situations. With Mercury moving into your sign on your birthday your most potent weapon will be common sense. Use it well."}, {"text": "Mars, your ruler, will encourage you to be assertive as the new week begins and that\u2019s a good thing. You need to push your own interests a little more forcefully than you have done of late \u2013 on the work front, of course, but in your private life, too."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if you seem to have lost your way recently because with mind planet Mercury moving into your sign today you will soon be on top of things again. What you thought was a major problem will turn out to have a simple solution."}, {"text": "Mars remains in your sign only until the middle of next week, so make the most of it. Decide which of your many ambitions means the most to you, then go after it with everything you\u2019ve got. Success is not a matter of IF but WHEN. Make it NOW!"}, {"text": "Relax. Take it easy. Don\u2019t wear yourself out. There may be a dozen and one things you think you need to do but nothing is as important as keeping your body and mind in good working order \u2013 and that means being kind to yourself."}, {"text": "You are not responsible for the world and its woes, so stop letting every little thing that goes wrong get to you and try enjoying life for a change. It might help if you switched off the news for a day, or even a week. Avoid doom and gloom."}, {"text": "Say what you have to say today but say it in a way that does not antagonize those on the receiving end of your words. You can at times be a bit too critical, so try looking at people\u2019s good points rather than their bad this coming week."}, {"text": "You may be impatient to be on the move but there is something that you need to take care of close to home, and if you don\u2019t do something about it now it will nag at you all week. Focus on what has to be done \u2013 and do it!"}, {"text": "Do you have the confidence to take control of a situation that is getting out of hand, and show the leadership skills to bring it back under control? Of course you do. Be decisive and make sure everyone knows that you are the boss."}, {"text": "Mars in the partnership area of your chart means you will encounter some forceful people over the next few days and the threat of falling out with them will never be far away. But now that you know that you will be less confrontational \u2013 won\u2019t you?"}, {"text": "A little bit of effort will go a long way today, and it will go further still if you put some serious thought into what you are doing. Too often you switch to automatic mode and go through the motions. Focus on being present in every moment."}, {"text": "You may be the sort who prefers to forgive and forget but today the universe will demand of you that you counter a wrong with a right. Some things are too important to just forget about, even if it means getting tough with someone you love."}, {"text": "Even if the questions you ask over the next 24 hours are simple it\u2019s unlikely you will get any straightforward answers. Does that mean that people are trying to deceive you? Maybe, but more likely it means they are just utterly confused themselves."}, {"text": "A Venus-Saturn link on your birthday means you need to get real about several of your relationships. Are they still worth the effort? Are they still working for you? Be honest in your answers, then act in ways that maximize your interests."}, {"text": "You can easily turn a failure into a triumph today, simple by changing the way you look at it. All experience is good experience, so stop judging yourself so harshly and simply enjoy what the moment brings your way \u2013 then, afterward, let it go."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste precious time trying to find a solution to a problem that is always going to be there. Some things in life have to be accepted as they are and what you are currently fixated on is one of them. It\u2019s really no big deal."}, {"text": "Even if you have a valid cause for complaint you are advised to bite your tongue and keep your anger to yourself over the next 24 hours. The planets warn if you lose your temper you will be the one who ends up being criticized the most."}, {"text": "No one expects you to be on top of everything, so don\u2019t expect it of yourself. If there is something you are having trouble with then ask for assistance. You may be surprised how many people come running to your rescue."}, {"text": "Does what you are about to do carry an acceptable risk, or is it the kind of gamble that is best avoided? Only you can answer that question for sure, so stand back and look at the situation for what it is, not what you wish it might be."}, {"text": "Tackle one task at a time and don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t seem to make much of a dent in your to-do list. The fact that you have finally got started is itself a major triumph. Get up early tomorrow and keep the momentum going."}, {"text": "A friend seems to believe they can persuade you to accept something that is clearly not true. They are going to be disappointed. If they have such a poor opinion of your mental capabilities maybe you should reconsider your relationship."}, {"text": "You will have to do something you don\u2019t want to do today but once you push yourself to get started you will find you quite enjoy it. It\u2019s the thought of the work that bores you, not the work itself, so get your act together and get it done."}, {"text": "The planets urge you to take things easy today. Don\u2019t exert yourself. Save your energy for what happens toward the end of the week, because you are going to be tested both physically and mentally. Current events are of minor importance."}, {"text": "If duty calls today, and it will, you must answer swiftly and decisively. Saturn in your sign will help you do what has to be done, even if it stretches you to the limits of your abilities. You\u2019re always capable of giving a little bit more."}, {"text": "The important thing today is that you recognize and accept your emotions, even the ones you wish you did not have. Your personality is made up of many different strands, each with its place in the being called \u201cyou\u201d, and each of equal importance."}, {"text": "Big changes are coming in your life, but will they be changes for the better or for the worse? The answer to that question depends almost entirely on the way you choose to interpret them. All change is good if seen from a higher perspective."}, {"text": "Your insights into everyday matters will astound those around you and it won\u2019t be long before all sorts of people are coming to you for advice. But don\u2019t use up all your mental power solving their problems \u2013 you\u2019ve got issues that need dealing with, too."}, {"text": "Is there something you have missed? Yes. Is there something you need to look at again? Yes. You may be impatient to move on Aries but the planets warn you need to resolve an outstanding issue first. It will nag at your brain until you do."}, {"text": "You have taken a certain train of thought about as far as it can go and now you need to encourage your mind to search further afield for the answers it seeks. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get stuck on one mental level \u2013 there is always something higher."}, {"text": "You seem to be on the verge of abandoning a project that no longer enthuses you, but before you do give it one more try. It may be the case that once you get into it again you rediscover what it was that inspired you in the first place."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s cosmic influences can help turn what looks like a setback into something a lot more positive, but you need to get other people involved. The more brain power you can bring to bear on a difficult situation the quicker you can resolve it."}, {"text": "You need to avoid going to extremes and the best way to do that is to make a conscious effort to understand the other person\u2019s side of the story. Or are you so fixed in your outlook that you cannot see there may be more than one interpretation?"}, {"text": "You may be of the opinion that you can do as you please, and maybe you can, but you also need to recognize that actions have consequences. Give some thought to your plans and make sure the likely outcome is beneficial, not just for you but for others too."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs business matters and investments means you know what needs to be done to maximize your profits. That\u2019s fine, of course, but don\u2019t forget that money isn\u2019t everything. What about love?"}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t want to fall out with someone you usually get along with it might be an idea to keep your thoughts about what they are doing to yourself. They don\u2019t want to hear your opinion, they want to be left alone to get on with it."}, {"text": "A job worth doing is a job worth doing well \u2013 and worth getting properly paid for it. If someone tries to persuade you to work for less today you must tell them in no uncertain terms it isn\u2019t going to happen. Know your worth and always demand it."}, {"text": "A little bit of thought now will result in major successes further down the line, so create some time and space to get your head together and visualize what it is you most want to accomplish. What\u2019s in your mind\u2019s eye today will be your reality tomorrow."}, {"text": "Play it cool today and don\u2019t worry about what other people might be saying. If you allow yourself to believe that a friend or colleague is talking behind your back it will distract you from more important matters. Talk is cheap \u2013 it\u2019s what you do that counts."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be short of ideas today but are they good ideas? The fact that mind planet Mercury is linked to Uranus, planet of genius, suggests strongly that they are, so get past your doubts and turn those good ideas into real achievements."}, {"text": "If you want to make the most of the coming year you need to get over a failure of some sort. Whatever it was it is now in the past, so put it out of your mind and never go back to it. Master your thoughts and you master the world."}, {"text": "A financial matter may take a bit of untangling but it will be worth it. Venus in your sign makes this one of the best times of the year for relationships, so don\u2019t let worries about more material issues get you down. Whatever the problem, love is the answer."}, {"text": "You seem to have a lot to say for yourself at the moment but with your ruling planet Venus at odds with Pluto, planet of power, you need to make sure you don\u2019t upset people in positions of authority. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to say too much."}, {"text": "With Mars in your sign you don\u2019t lack for confidence but you need to remember that confidence can only take you so far. Above all today, avoid making the kind of outrageous promises that are almost guaranteed to leave people disappointed in you."}, {"text": "It may feel as if time is running out and that you have to do something big right now but don\u2019t be hasty. Focus on making a good job of what is in front of you and don\u2019t let the ticking of the clock cause you to panic."}, {"text": "This may be one of the more challenging times of the year for you but it won\u2019t be long before your confidence comes flooding back. That is likely to happen sooner if you surround yourself with people whose positivity and passion for life can inspire you."}, {"text": "The more praise you get today the more you need to keep your feet on the ground, because the planets warn that one of the people who is now talking you up would actually like to talk you down. Don\u2019t let mere words turn your head."}, {"text": "Some of the things going on in your world at the moment may not be to your liking but there is no reason why they should inconvenience you to any great extent. The best way to deal with them is to ignore them and carry on having fun."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t give in to the urge to say something you know is untrue just to please other people. You may not want to hurt their feelings but the truth is sacrosanct and must not be avoided. You don\u2019t have to be brutal but you must be honest."}, {"text": "Sit back and let others take care of the heavy lifting. The sun in the well-being area of your chart warns if you push yourself too hard you will surely regret it, so pace yourself sensibly and, most importantly of all, know when to say \u201cno\u201d."}, {"text": "You may not be the most radical member of the zodiac but you have your moments and with the sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you\u2019ll have one or more such moments today. Say or do something that shocks. It will be fun."}, {"text": "The answers you are looking for are not far away, so keep asking questions that stretch your mind. Sometimes you can be a bit too fixed in your opinions, but you won\u2019t find it so hard to be flexible today \u2013 and the results could be enlightening."}, {"text": "The sun links with Neptune, your ruler, today, so the best bits of your Pisces nature will be on show. Do something creative or artistic, something that is not only fun in itself but which also lifts up the thoughts and feelings of other people."}, {"text": "The path you are on will take you in some strange directions over the coming year but that\u2019s not a reason to leave it and take another one. On the contrary, the experiences they bring will make you a better person on every level \u2013 and that\u2019s what life is about."}, {"text": "Good fortune of a financial nature should be coming your way now and if it isn\u2019t it can only be because your negative thoughts are driving it away. Think only positive thoughts today and over the weekend and see what a difference it makes."}, {"text": "You will look back from later in the year and be amazed at what you did in the month of May. The sun won\u2019t stay in your sign forever though, so get out into the world and make things happen \u2013 and make them not just big but huge!"}, {"text": "It may seem to other people that you are not doing much at the moment, and to an extent that is true, but under the surface you are making plans and getting yourself ready for the challenges and opportunities to come. Good preparation is a must."}, {"text": "The pace of life may be hectic at the moment but you don\u2019t mind at all, not least because you are surrounded by friends who help you every step of the way. The reason they appreciate you so much is because you have always appreciated them."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t sit back and wait for good things to come your way \u2013 get out there and grab them for yourself. It is your cosmic right to enjoy life as much as is humanely possible, and the only thing that can limit you is the extent of your own imagination."}, {"text": "There are so many things going on in your life at the moment that you are beginning to think you may have overextended yourself. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll cope \u2013 although, yes, you might cope a bit better if you were to delegate certain minor duties."}, {"text": "If you think happy, you will be happy. If you think sad, you will be sad. On a mental level you know that to be true, but you need to internalize it until it becomes second nature. Act as if life is a wonderful adventure \u2013 and it will be."}, {"text": "Be nice to people today, even to those whose outlook and attitude may be anything but positive. You may not be able to control what people think of you but you can control the way you choose to react to it \u2013 and it\u2019s best not to react at all."}, {"text": "If a friend asks you to do something you disagree with today you must have the strength to turn them down. Even if it puts a strain on your relationship it is still the right thing to do. A little further down the road they will realize that, too."}, {"text": "The sun remains in the most dynamic area of your chart only until the 21st and you must make the most of it. Believe that all things are possible and go all out to make a name for yourself in the world. Make sure it\u2019s a good name!"}, {"text": "Some people may say you are being too cautious but there is a reason you are hanging back at the moment. It\u2019s because you can sense that something big is about to happen and you don\u2019t want to commit yourself just yet. You\u2019re right to bide your time."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you will try to conform to an image that other people have of you, rather than just be yourself. It\u2019s nice that they should have such a positive view of who you are but you have a dark side too. It\u2019s called being human."}, {"text": "Anyone who is under the impression that you prefer to keep a low profile won\u2019t recognize you this year as you go all out to get yourself noticed. You won\u2019t have to force it either: seems like you\u2019re back in love with life again \u2013 and life loves you, too."}, {"text": "It might be a smart idea to tone down your act a bit over the next 48 hours. The current cosmic set-up warns this may not be the best of times to call attention to yourself. Besides, you\u2019ll have a lot more fun if you fly under the radar."}, {"text": "You may have nothing to hide but that does not give you the right to probe into other people\u2019s affairs to see what they have been up to. If you do, they\u2019ll remember it \u2013 and at some point in the future you may be the one under scrutiny."}, {"text": "You can blaze your own trail if you wish this weekend Gemini, but it will be a whole lot easier if you follow a path that others have marked out already. Why waste time making so much effort when you can benefit from those who have gone before you?"}, {"text": "Some things in life you have to do on your own but others are best done alongside those who share your aims and ambitions. Make a point this weekend of working with people you know already or people you would like to know better."}, {"text": "You may think you can get away with almost anything, and maybe you can, but only in the short-term. What goes around always comes around eventually, and the planets warn that if you take advantage of someone this weekend they will take advantage of you later on."}, {"text": "Now that you don\u2019t feel under so much pressure you will find you have more time to spend with those you love. Some say that Virgo is a rather unemotional sign but it isn\u2019t true. You\u2019re just more self-controlled than most other people."}, {"text": "The danger now is that you think the danger is past and you can do as you please. Inevitably, reality will come knocking and before long you may find that you are back where you started. So, be cautious and take nothing for granted."}, {"text": "Some of the plans you made over the past week or so will have to be revised over the next 48 hours. The fact is you were a bit too hasty in deciding what would be best for you and forgot that those around you might want something different."}, {"text": "It\u2019s true that you have strayed a bit off course of late but it\u2019s no big deal. In fact it may even work in your favour in that it opens your mind to new possibilities. Every time a mistake is made it leads to a new learning opportunity."}, {"text": "Be careful what you ask for because, having got it, you may decide it\u2019s not for you after all. Saturn in your sign is going through one of its retrograde phases, which means that for every step forward you take you may have to take two steps back."}, {"text": "Focus on the one thing that matters this weekend and forget about everything else. Some people, especially those who are naturally laidback, may complain that you are too tunnel-visioned but sometimes you have to be if you want to get important things done."}, {"text": "Whatever it is you are working on at the moment make sure you do a stunningly good job. You may not realize it but you are being watched by people who, if they so choose, can do your ambitions a lot of good. Show them what makes you special."}, {"text": "They say brain is better than brawn and what happens over the next few months will prove that point in ways you may not have expected. Others may have the position and the power to make things happen but you have the intelligence to outwit them."}, {"text": "You will find ways to get what you desire today but your methods may not meet with the approval of everyone. Will you care about that? Of course not. As far as you are concerned all is fair in love, war and business, especially the latter."}, {"text": "The best way to get people on your side is to bombard them with facts and figures \u2013 which should, of course, be genuine. You don\u2019t have time for subtlety or long-winded persuasion, there are things that need to be done and they must be done now."}, {"text": "An issue you should have resolved a long time ago will come to the fore again today and this time you must deal with it once and for all. Spend less time talking and more time acting. It\u2019s what you do that counts, not what you say."}, {"text": "The message of the stars today is that you must not let your fears get the better of you. As a Cancer you tend to be susceptible to suggestion and minor worries could easily develop into major anxieties if you don\u2019t stay tough mentally."}, {"text": "If you need help with something you don\u2019t think you can handle on your own today then ask for it. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness or failure, it\u2019s just an admission that you are human like everyone else \u2013 even if you sometimes like to pretend you\u2019re not"}, {"text": "It should be a lot easier to get your message across today, but is your message worth getting across? There is a lot to be said for keeping your opinions to yourself, especially on the work front where your comments could be deliberately misinterpreted."}, {"text": "The truth is not something that should be suppressed, not even for reasons you believe to be for the common good. The opposite of the truth is, of course, a lie and if you bend or ignore the facts today it could catch up with you later on."}, {"text": "Your attitude toward someone you work or do business with seems to have hardened of late and even if they offer to meet you halfway you may well refuse. You are right to want nothing to do with them as the planets warn they are up to no good."}, {"text": "Take the time and make the effort to spell out what it is you are planning to do over the coming weeks and months. Once those around you have a clear idea of your objectives they are much less likely to fear you or stand in your way."}, {"text": "Capricorn is a sign that should be giving orders, not taking them, so make sure you are the one who is calling the shots. Not everyone will take kindly to your high-handed attitude but that won\u2019t bother you in the slightest, just so long as they obey."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t lack for confidence at the moment and you won\u2019t hesitate to tell those you interact with where they have been going wrong. In which case, let\u2019s hope you know what you are talking about or the roles could be reversed by the end of the week."}, {"text": "You can quite easily explain the reason for the actions you have taken in recent weeks, but you probably won\u2019t. As far as you are concerned it doesn\u2019t matter if others understand or support you, it matters only that they do as they are told."}, {"text": "Your options in life may be unlimited but you still need to decide what two or three things mean the most to you \u2013 then you need to focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. The formula for success is to have a plan and an aim."}, {"text": "You may be assertive by nature but you will need more than just a go-getting attitude to make things happen this week. Over the next few days you must make alliances with people who in the past have been rivals, maybe even enemies. You can do it."}, {"text": "Everything worth having in life will come to you in time, so don\u2019t push too hard or expect too much of yourself. Yes, of course, you should make an effort but your efforts must be calm and well directed. You certainly don\u2019t have to do everything at once."}, {"text": "Time spent checking details will not be time wasted today \u2013 in fact it could save you a great deal of money. It could also make you some unexpected cash if you discover something that your competitors have missed. Don\u2019t ignore the small stuff."}, {"text": "You will have to deal with at least one and maybe several relationship problems over the next few days, but that\u2019s okay. The good news is they will be easier to resolve then you thought they would \u2013 so stop wasting time and get on with it."}, {"text": "You will have to focus intensely on something you don\u2019t much enjoy today, but the good news is the results will be very much to your liking. The important thing is that you make a start, because until you do that nothing else will occur."}, {"text": "The most important thing this week is that you use your talents for positive purposes. If you decide, for whatever reason, to hinder people rather than help them you can expect the universe to punish you. What goes around always comes around eventually."}, {"text": "No matter how much you try to persuade a friend or work colleague to see things your way they won\u2019t change their mind. It may be intensely annoying that they seem stuck in the past but they are as entitled to their opinions as you are to yours."}, {"text": "There is not much point trying to explain to other people what you are planning to do because the planets indicate they won\u2019t understand. Trust that your instincts will guide you and trust that the universe will protect you. What others say or do is of no importance."}, {"text": "You have been through so many changes of late that your head is probably still in a spin. Be that as it may you need to be ready for more changes over the next few days. These changes, hopefully, will be more to your liking."}, {"text": "If there is something you have left undone then get on with it now and complete it. It\u2019s not often you get a second chance in life but according to the planets a window of opportunity is about to open and this time you must climb through it!"}, {"text": "Some of the things that used to worry you so much no longer have a hold over you, and that\u2019s great, but that does not mean everything can stay as it is. You still need to make some serious changes, and you can\u2019t put them off much longer."}, {"text": "In the greater scheme of things you have precious little to worry about but you can\u2019t help fretting about something that is minor in the extreme. The way to get past it is to confront it head on \u2013 then you will see just how unimportant it is."}, {"text": "No matter what your critics and detractors may say to the contrary, you know what it is you should be doing with your life, so get on and do it and don\u2019t let a single doubt cross your mind. Don\u2019t explain and don\u2019t complain, just act \u2013 and fast!"}, {"text": "You need to find ways to balance your domestic responsibilities with your career ambitions, especially as the planets suggest that work-related issues are going to take up more of your time. People in positions of power are relying on you \u2013 but so are your loved ones."}, {"text": "People who cannot make up their minds quickly can be incredibly frustrating but the more you try to hurry them along, the more they seem to drag things out. Take the hint and stop trying so hard. Do what you have to do and forget about other people."}, {"text": "A decision needs to be taken concerning your financial situation and if you take it now you should be able to find ways to improve your cash flow, at least in the short term. In the long term, of course, you need to spend less \u2013 a lot less."}, {"text": "A battle of wills is to be expected today but as the planets indicate that neither side can win, you are advised to look for compromise solutions. Others are more likely to give ground if you go first and give a little ground yourself to start with."}, {"text": "So you made an error of some kind. So what? No one is perfect, not even a Leo, so learn what you can from the situation and then put it behind you. No one will think less of you for admitting that you don\u2019t always get it right."}, {"text": "If you find yourself arguing with someone over a subject you feel strongly about today you must make sure it does not get out of hand. What starts out as light-hearted banter could quickly degenerate into a rather nasty war of words."}, {"text": "Your options may be a bit limited at the moment, but that\u2019s okay. A week from now the cosmic picture will change dramatically and suddenly you will be free to go your own way and do your own thing. Until then, relax and accept your current position."}, {"text": "You will discover something today that appalls you and you must make that fact clear to people who expect you to go along with their plans. This is one of those occasions when following your conscience is more important than being on the winning side."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t lack for advice today but is it good advice? According to the planets what you are being told may sound logical but in reality is little more than wishful thinking. So how do you know what to do? You listen to your inner voice, that\u2019s all."}, {"text": "There are times when it is simply impossible to forgive and forget and this is one of them. If someone has wronged you then make sure they know you are not pleased about it \u2013 and make sure they are never in a position where they can do it again."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste time and energy trying to work out the whys and wherefores of a situation that clearly makes no sense at all. Just get as far away from it as you can and let those who seem to enjoy sorting out mysteries deal with it."}, {"text": "You may be reluctant to voice your disapproval of something today but you must. A part of you knows that what other people are doing isn\u2019t right and if you don\u2019t say something about it you will be to blame as well. Principle comes first \u2013 always."}, {"text": "Do you have a clear idea of what it is you want most out of life? If so, get on with it. If not, spend time on your birthday assessing your options. What is the one thing that inspires you more than anything else? Make that one thing your guiding star."}, {"text": "If you have an important decision to make about your job, especially if it involves money, then make sure you know all the facts. It may be the case that someone is hoping you will accept less than you are entitled to \u2013 because that means more for them."}, {"text": "You know what you want and you know where to get it \u2013 so what are you waiting for? There is a danger now that you will be a bit too laidback for your own good, so remind yourself what it is you want to accomplish, then motivate yourself to act."}, {"text": "Worry less and ignore what other people are saying about you. Talk is cheap and there is absolutely nothing that anyone can say that will harm you in any substantial way, so act first and worry about it later. Better still, don\u2019t worry about it at all."}, {"text": "Be nice to everyone today, even people who may not deserve it. The sun in the friendship area of your chart means that what you do for other people now will be done for you later on, so do good things only \u2013 and do them with a smile."}, {"text": "If you need assistance then you must let others know about it. It would be nice if they could read your mind and come to your aid without being asked but it isn\u2019t going to happen, so speak up and make sure they know what you need."}, {"text": "Your mind may be full of good ideas but you need to do something with them. The sun is nearing the end of its journey through the most adventurous area of your chart, so start something amazing now or it may never happen, and that would be a shame."}, {"text": "You know that a certain course of action is not right for you, so why are you still thinking about it? As your ruler Venus changes signs today you need to change the way you look at what you are doing \u2013 and maybe not do it after all."}, {"text": "Follow your conscience today, even if it clashes with what the majority of people around you think is right and proper. Just because they are all moving in a particular direction does not mean you must move that way, too. Be a leader, not a follower."}, {"text": "You may think that your rivals and competitors are smart, and maybe they are, but you are smarter, not least because you know how to stand back from the situation you are in and, if necessary, make adjustments. They don\u2019t possess that flexibility."}, {"text": "This is still a great time of year for you and you must make the most of it. When the sun changes signs on the 21st the cosmic powers that be won\u2019t be quite so much on your side, so get your act together and make things happen now."}, {"text": "The more tempted you are to cut corners and break rules today the more you will need to exercise self-restraint. You may gain in the short term but over a longer period your reputation will suffer and that\u2019s something to be avoided."}, {"text": "It may be the case that certain people have not been pulling their weight but what does it matter? Do you rely on their efforts to such an extent that you cannot succeed without them? Of course not. Keep doing what you are doing, and doing it well."}, {"text": "You will find your voice over the coming 12 months \u2013 and what a voice it will be. You will speak with so much authority and so much belief that others will rally to your cause. Make sure your cause is a righteous one. Change the world for the better."}, {"text": "You will need to curb your possessive tendencies today. Some things you own and some things you share and some things can never be yours. That applies to people too: If you try to limit what friends can do they may not be friends for long!"}, {"text": "You will be in an extremely sociable mood over the next few days and that\u2019s good, but don\u2019t overdo it. Yes, it\u2019s nice to be in demand, but if you spread your favours too thin you could end up rushing from one place to another and exhausting yourself."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much about Mars leaving your birth sign today. You may feel an initial dip in energy but with the sun moving in to your sign early next week you won\u2019t be down for long. Use the next few days to get your breath back."}, {"text": "One of the best times of the year begins for you today as Mars enters your sign. Not only that but helpful aspects to mind planet Mercury suggest you know exactly how you are going to use the extra energy that Mars brings with it. You\u2019re an unstoppable force!"}, {"text": "You may not be one for self-analysis but something will happen today that persuades you to look at what you are doing and what your motives for doing it may be. Could it be that your time would be better spent doing something else? Yes, it could!"}, {"text": "Life is too short to worry about what other people might think of you, so do what you want to do to the best of your abilities, do it with a smile, and don\u2019t waste a single moment wondering how the world around you will react."}, {"text": "As Mars moves into the career area of your chart today you will most likely be challenged by someone who sees you as a rival. You may not want to compete with them but you have no choice in the matter, so prove you are the best."}, {"text": "Chances are you will get more than you bargained for today, and you will handle it with ease. Cosmic activity in your fellow water sign of Cancer will make you sensitive to changes but you won\u2019t be the least bit sensitive about how you deal with them!"}, {"text": "The reason that a friend did not confide in you is because they know how hard it is for you to keep a secret. Don\u2019t hold a grudge about it, because they were right, you do have a tendency to let slip what should be and stay private information."}, {"text": "As Mars moves into the partnership area of your chart today you must expect those around you to become a bit more assertive, which means you can no longer just issue orders and expect them to be obeyed. You\u2019ll need to be more subtle than that."}, {"text": "You may be under pressure at the moment but that will inspire you to raise your game and show what you can do. Just be careful that you don\u2019t push too hard and burn yourself out physically and mentally. Even Aquarius has limits."}, {"text": "There can be no more excuses and no more half measures. Now that Mars is moving into the most dynamic area of your chart you must get busy on a creative project that requires a serious input of time and effort on your part. Start now!"}, {"text": "Others may try to tell you that might makes right and that being strong is all that matters, but you must not let that kind of negative outlook infect your thinking this year. Principle is more important than power, and love is more important than material success."}, {"text": "If someone offers you something for nothing today or over the weekend you will, of course, suspect there might be a catch \u2013 and you will be right. It may annoy you that they seem to believe you are so easily fooled but it shows they lack judgment."}, {"text": "It might be wise to wait until the sun leaves your sign early next week before making a decision about a money matter that has been causing you problems. Chances are it is not nearly as bad as you fear, so give it time to put itself right."}, {"text": "A few days from now the sun will be in your sign and a new cycle will have begun. Between now and then take time out of your busy schedule to look ahead and decide what your goals are going to be. Make sure they are big ones!"}, {"text": "Someone whose views you disagree with profoundly will rub you the wrong way over the next few days and it\u2019s unlikely you will be able to resist having a go at them. Try not to get emotional about it though or you may go way over the top."}, {"text": "As tomorrow\u2019s full moon takes place in the domestic area of your chart you must expect partners and loved ones to be more emotional than usual, but you cannot allow their negative feelings to rub off on you. Stay calm and, above all, think straight."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s move into the career area of your chart early next week will inspire you to get out into the world and make your mark. It\u2019s not true that Virgo is a sign that lacks ambition \u2013 you just don\u2019t like to make a big scene about it."}, {"text": "The approaching full moon could tempt you to splash out on things you don\u2019t really need and if you do you are sure to regret it next week when you find you don\u2019t have enough left over to make ends meet. Curb your spendthrift ways Libra!"}, {"text": "The only real danger today is that in your haste to get ahead you may take the kind of risk that could easily backfire. It\u2019s not like you to be so impulsive Scorpio, so calm down and think clearly about what it is you are about to do."}, {"text": "The more assertive you are today the less effective your efforts will be. People you live and work with have no intention of doing what you tell them to do and the sooner you accept that fact the better off everyone, including yourself, will be."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that you are beginning to question why you are doing certain things, and whether you have taken on too much. Tomorrow\u2019s full moon will clear away your mental fog and help you see your current situation for what it is."}, {"text": "The times they are a-changing and what occurs over the next few days may catch you by surprise. The good news is that with the sun soon to move into the best area of your chart you are far more likely to be a winner than a loser."}, {"text": "Your emotions are all over the place at the moment and tomorrow\u2019s full moon will surely add to the upheaval. But that\u2019s okay. The fact that you are dissatisfied with your current lot in life means you are more likely to make much-needed changes."}, {"text": "There will be times this year when it seems as if you have no control over what is going on, but even if that is true you must not panic. Keep a cool head at all times and you\u2019ll find you can cope quite easily with what fate sends your way."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t fret if someone you work or do business with decides that they no longer want to continue with your current project. You are quite capable of moving ahead without them, in fact you may go even faster and further. You don\u2019t need passengers."}, {"text": "It is a simple fact that you get along better with some people than you do with others \u2013 it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Today\u2019s full moon will highlight your differences with certain individuals, and that\u2019s fine. Some people are not worth the effort."}, {"text": "A colleague who resents your success and popularity will seek to undermine you in some way today, but now that you know that you can be on your guard. Let them say whatever they like about you \u2013 their words are nonsense and will have no lasting effect."}, {"text": "You may need to remind yourself of the fact that it is never worth making an enemy over something trivial. To begin with what annoys you today may not seem trivial at all, but if you stand back from it for a few minutes you\u2019ll realize it is."}, {"text": "Whatever else you do today don\u2019t sell yourself short. Let everyone you have dealings with know that you demand to receive the respect you deserve and the financial rewards you have so clearly earned. And make it sound as if you mean it!"}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need to put on a show today, Virgo. You don\u2019t need to play a role and prove you\u2019re a star. Be happy with who and what you are and expect others to be happy with it, too. And if they are not? Too bad, it\u2019s their loss."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s full moon could have you acting in some rather strange ways, so be on your guard both in your personal life and at work. And keep a firm grip on the purse strings too, as you could find no end of reasons to flash the cash."}, {"text": "A full moon in your sign warns you could lose your temper for no apparent reason today, and the results will be costly on both a personal and a financial level. Yes, some people can be a real pain, but try not to let them get to you so much."}, {"text": "You may look calm on the outside but on the inside your feelings are all over the place and if you are not careful you could end up saying and doing things that cause all sorts of problems \u2013 not just for other people but for you as well."}, {"text": "If you expect the worst to happen it will. If you expect the best to happen then even if the worst does happen it won\u2019t seem so bad. Today\u2019s full moon signals upheavals of one sort or another but it\u2019s up to you how you choose to react to them."}, {"text": "Avoid making any kind of decision about your work or career today. The influence of the full moon is such that even if you strive to get it right there is sure to be something you have overlooked, something that pushes your conclusions way off target."}, {"text": "If you start something new today you may find it hard to keep at it for any length of time. Save your energy for when it will do most good. When is that? When the sun and Mercury change signs on the 21st. In the meantime, take it easy."}, {"text": "The sacrifices you make over the coming year will pay off in ways you cannot possibly imagine, so trust in the universe to protect you and let that small voice in the back of your head guide you \u2013 it\u2019s the part of you that knows all the answers."}, {"text": "This is a time to be on the move, physically and mentally. Even if you are unable to wander far from home there are still plenty of things you can do to stretch your body and expand your mind, so use your imagination and find ways to improve yourself."}, {"text": "The most important thing today is that you make an effort to identify your priorities. And remember: They must be your priorities, not the priorities that others think you should have. Top of the list must be getting your financial house in order."}, {"text": "The sun moves into your birth sign tomorrow, marking the start of a brand new cycle. What matters most now is that you forget about what happened yesterday and the day before and focus your mind exclusively on what you hope and pray will happen next."}, {"text": "It would appear that certain people are not taking you seriously and you need to do something about that. You could start by refusing to follow their lead and allowing your own ideas and insights to guide you. In other words, take yourself seriously first."}, {"text": "There is a solution to the problem you are struggling with, so don\u2019t give up on it. A few days from now you will look back and laugh at yourself for believing you would never work out what you should be doing. The answer is glaringly obvious."}, {"text": "The next few days will see you making some major changes on the work front, changes that may well bring you into conflict with other people. Don\u2019t worry about what they think of you, just allow the universe to guide you by following your instincts."}, {"text": "You need to escape from whoever or whatever you feel is holding you back. The sun\u2019s move into one of the more dynamic areas of your chart tomorrow will encourage you to junk what is old and outdated and upgrade to a better version of your current self."}, {"text": "You have so many options to choose from at the moment that you may actually come to a stop and do nothing. If in doubt, go with the option that promises the most financial gain in the long-term. You can get rich, but it won\u2019t be quick."}, {"text": "Take things easy today, especially if you have been pushing yourself to extremes over the past few weeks. You\u2019ve done your share of the heavy lifting and have every right to reward yourself with a break. Also, spend more quality time with those you love."}, {"text": "Your mind has been so full of big ideas of late that you may have forgotten about the practicalities. Now you must work out which of those ideas stands a serious chance of becoming a reality. Most likely it\u2019s the one you feel most passionate about."}, {"text": "The universe is very much on your side at the moment and over the next few days there will be a number of hints and prompts to get you moving in the right direction. Creatively and romantically you are on the cusp of a fantastic new phase."}, {"text": "The more certain people try to make you feel guilty about what you are doing the more you should do it. This is one of those occasions when you need to stop putting other people first and focus more on your own needs and desires. They\u2019re valid too."}, {"text": "You will get no end of chances to prove yourself but don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking you have to take advantage of them all. Be selective in the goals you go for and realize that one thing done really well is what you will be remembered for."}, {"text": "Can you tell fact from fiction? Let\u2019s hope so because someone is going to spin you a line today and your mind will need to be alert to spot where they are trying to trick you. If in doubt, let your instincts guide you \u2013 they are seldom wrong."}, {"text": "If there is something that has yet to be finished, something that should have been put to bed days if not weeks ago, then you still have just enough time to complete it. But it\u2019s got to be today \u2013 because you won\u2019t get another chance."}, {"text": "The sun and Mercury both enter your birth sign tomorrow, so in a way your year is about to begin again. Forget about what happened yesterday, or last week, or last month \u2013 the only thing that matters is what you will do in the future."}, {"text": "You have nothing to worry about and a great deal to look forward to and it is essential that you remind yourself of that fact every chance you get. The sun\u2019s imminent change of signs must not be allowed to affect your thinking in a negative way."}, {"text": "You will need to work closer than you have been doing with friends and colleagues over the next few weeks. You may be a leader by nature but sometimes even Leo has to accept that real strength comes from being part of a team."}, {"text": "As both the sun and Mercury, your ruling planet, move into the career area of your chart tomorrow the next few days are going to be hugely important for your work and for the position you hold in the world. Aim high, then go higher still!"}, {"text": "Put any worries you may have out of your mind and start smiling wider than you have ever smiled before. As from tomorrow there will be no holding you back \u2013 it will be love and laughs all the way \u2013 and you may be on your way travel-wise too."}, {"text": "Partnerships and relationships won\u2019t be quite so intense over the next few days as they have been in recent weeks and that\u2019s good. But don\u2019t think you can completely ignore issues that have divided you. They will still be there, lurking in the background."}, {"text": "You are about to enter a more positive phase but it is also a phase in which you will need to take more notice of the people you interact with on a one-to-one level. Their needs and your needs must be brought into a more pleasing alignment."}, {"text": "The sun moves out of your fellow earth sign of Taurus tomorrow and that means, among other things, that you will have to get a bit more serious about your well-being. To put it at its most basic: Don\u2019t work yourself to a standstill Capricorn!"}, {"text": "One of the best times of the year is about to begin and there will be no stopping you over the next four weeks or so. Just remember to slow down occasionally and admire the scenery along the way. It\u2019s not about doing top speed all the time."}, {"text": "A number of new duties and responsibilities will come your way this week, some of them to do with your domestic situation, and you must not try to avoid them. You can still have fun, of course, but make sure there\u2019s a method to your madness."}, {"text": "The sun and Mercury join forces on your birthday in a way that will clarify what needs to be done to make your life more successful and enjoyable. Understanding the world is important, of course, but understanding yourself is what will give you an edge."}, {"text": "Get out into the world and have fun today. Your open and optimistic nature will attract people to you and you will share plenty of laughs. Your progress will be smooth and easy over the next few weeks, so start enjoying life again."}, {"text": "Try not to commit yourself to any big decisions today, especially decisions of a financial nature. Also, although the sun in the money area of your chart will take care of your needs, that is not an excuse to go on a spending spree."}, {"text": "A new solar year begins for you today and as Mercury, your ruling planet, moves into your sign as well there is precious little you cannot do. Good things are about to happen, the kind of things you will look back on fondly for years to come."}, {"text": "The message of the stars today is that you should not do things for people that they should be doing for themselves. Don\u2019t let friends and family members make you feel guilty about doing less for them \u2013 they need you to push them, not protect them."}, {"text": "Over the next few days you will start to see the effects of something you started earlier in the year, and the effects will be good. They could be better still in the future if you get more people involved. You can\u2019t do it all on your own."}, {"text": "Try not to think in terms of winning and losing. It might appear as if the situation you are in is \u201cdo or die\u201d but it isn\u2019t that drastic. Life is not a zero sum game and if you play it right today everyone can be a winner."}, {"text": "Over the next few days everything will fall into place and you will see the connections that have always been there but which you somehow managed to miss. Once that occurs life will be a happier, sunnier place and you will no longer be the odd one out."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to be nice to people just because you feel it is expected of you. You certainly don\u2019t have to be nice to them if they are your rivals. Do what is good for you today, regardless of what others might think of it."}, {"text": "As the sun and Mercury move into your opposite sign today you will quickly discover that partnership matters are of even more importance than they used to be. Don\u2019t do things just for yourself, do them for other people too. Life is a team game."}, {"text": "You will have to make a few adjustments to your working routine but once they are in place everything will flow a lot easier. You may find it hard to reject old habits but until you do you won\u2019t be able to move on in any meaningful sense."}, {"text": "You need to get rid of that negative outlook you have been carrying around with you and start seeing life from a more joyful perspective. The sun in Gemini will help you get your act together and once it\u2019s together there will be no stopping you."}, {"text": "A Mars-Uranus link on your birthday means not only that your instincts will be super sensitive but that you will act on them quickly and decisively. It\u2019s quite possible you will do something spectacular this year. You certainly won\u2019t be ignored."}, {"text": "Someone you work with is likely to challenge you today, but why should that worry you? Aries is a sign that enjoys being tested, so take them on and show them you are every bit as good as they are, if not ten times better."}, {"text": "You like to shock people occasionally, both to keep them on their toes and to enjoy the look of amazement on their faces. But don\u2019t go too far and say or do something for which you may never be forgiven. There are limits, even for Taurus."}, {"text": "It is more than likely that you will find yourself in a fight or flight situation today and the only sensible option is to run away. If that isn\u2019t possible, keep your temper under control and try to defuse the situation with your sparkling wit."}, {"text": "If you go it alone today you will do well, but if you work with others you will do even better. With Mars in your sign you feel you can win any battle, and maybe you can, but it will be easier if you have an army behind you."}, {"text": "It is odds on that the pressure you find yourself under at the moment has been brought on by your own action, or inaction, rather than by what other people have been doing. So what do you do about it? You can start by cutting back on your commitments."}, {"text": "You will find yourself drawn to someone today who is about as different from you personality-wise as it is possible to get. Have fun with them by all means but don\u2019t take your relationship too seriously. It\u2019s unlikely to stand the test of time."}, {"text": "You know what you want, you know where to get it, and nothing \u2013 repeat, nothing \u2013 will be allowed to stand in your way. You don\u2019t have to be ruthless about it but you do need to focus on your objective to the exclusion of everything else."}, {"text": "This is one of those times when you must take risks, even if your sixth sense tells you it might not be a good idea. The fact is if you don\u2019t act decisively now then some people might start having doubts about you, and you can\u2019t allow that."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t need to raise your voice to be heard today. On the contrary, the softer you speak the more others will take notice. Why? Because they can tell that you are being serious, and a serious Sagittarius is not to be trifled with."}, {"text": "Push yourself hard over the next 24 hours, and push those around you hard as well. Mars in your opposite sign means that others will respond better if you crack the whip a bit. But only a bit \u2013 you don\u2019t want to put them out of action!"}, {"text": "Uranus, your ruler, is aligned with Mars today, so follow your instincts and put every last ounce of energy you have into what you are working on. This is one of those days when you can get a huge amount done, so don\u2019t waste it."}, {"text": "The more you worry about making mistakes today the more likely it is they will come about, so close your mind to any kind of negative thinking and believe \u2013 really, truly, utterly believe \u2013 that you are on the winning side, and you will be."}, {"text": "By all means think deeply about your own life and the lives of those around you this year, but make sure your overall attitude is positive and fun-loving. Whatever you choose to do, do it with a smile on your face and a song in your heart."}, {"text": "What you need to realize is that there are only so many hours in a day and trying to cram everything in to just 24 hours is a recipe for chaos. Instead, try to slow things right down \u2013 that way you may actually get more done."}, {"text": "Resist the temptation to ridicule someone\u2019s point of view today. It may seem stupid to you but from where they stand it not only makes sense but also has meaning on a personal level. Just this once, keep your opinions to yourself."}, {"text": "Try not to get too serious about what you are expected to take care of today. Keep your workload as light as you can and don\u2019t stress about what you have to do. An easygoing attitude will make even the most tedious of tasks bearable."}, {"text": "You will need to be on your guard today as the planets warn that someone you work or do business with could turn against you for no apparent reason. As a general rule of thumb, anyone who says \u201ctrust me\u201d is definitely not to be trusted!"}, {"text": "You will be tempted to do something irrational today. Why? You have absolutely no idea. You are just in one of those moods where it seems like fun to do things that those around you don\u2019t expect. It\u2019s okay to be a bit silly occasionally."}, {"text": "Under no circumstances try to appease someone who is giving you a hard time, because that will only encourage them to be even more negative toward you. But don\u2019t get angry either. Stay calm, say nothing and simply remove yourself from their presence."}, {"text": "If what a friend or work colleague tells you today does not ring true you must make sure you are protected. Keep your suspicions to yourself but under no circumstances give them the impression that you believe every word they say."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to decide whether your glass is half full or half empty but that\u2019s okay. Look on the bright side if you can but accept that now and again doubts are going to creep into your mind. You\u2019re only human after all."}, {"text": "Someone you have dealings with is about as different from you as it is possible to get and there is every possibility that you will fall out in some way today. Let it happen. Once you have both said your piece you will respect each other again."}, {"text": "Although communications planet Mercury links with Saturn, your ruler, today, you must be careful what you say, especially when dealing with people above you on the career or social ladder. They may not appreciate your criticisms, however mild or accurate."}, {"text": "There is a very real danger that you will overdo it today. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart compels you to push ahead on all fronts but if you push too hard you could hurt yourself. You have limits Aquarius, just like everyone else."}, {"text": "Steer clear of extremes, both in your personal life and at work. If you find yourself getting angry with someone in a position of power you should zip your lip and walk away. If the situation escalates it could be you who comes off worse."}, {"text": "Put all failures and disappointments behind you once and for all and begin again with a clean slate. Draw a line under the past and refuse to revisit it either in your mind or in your heart. Only two things matter: today and tomorrow."}, {"text": "You will get what you want eventually but you might get it quicker if you use persuasion rather than pressure. Mars, your ruling planet, warns that people are not in the mood to be forced, but they won\u2019t mind a bit of outrageous flattery."}, {"text": "Important information must be kept to yourself. If you let slip something that you are not at liberty to divulge the consequences could be dire, not only for yourself but for other people, too. If everyone knows then it will no longer be special."}, {"text": "Most things are going well for you now but you are still focusing too much on the past. What you do today and over the weekend will become a part of your future, so do it with passion and pride and let the world see how special you are."}, {"text": "It may take a bit of an effort to control your temper today but it will be worth it. The more a certain person deserves to feel the edge of your tongue the more you need to remind yourself that staying cool is essential. Think of your reputation."}, {"text": "Your hectic schedule means you may be finding it hard to catch your breath but you really do need to slow down a bit. Don\u2019t worry if you fall behind in your workload today, you can catch up later on when you feel 100 per cent again."}, {"text": "A new responsibility will take up a big slice of your time today and over the weekend, so don\u2019t expect to be able to come and go as you please. If you are serious about what you are expected to do you will handle it with ease."}, {"text": "You need to take a more subtle approach with your rivals. The planets warn if you attack them head-on you stand a good chance of losing, but if you play it smart and find out their weaknesses you will beat them with ease. Think and act tactically."}, {"text": "If friends tell you one thing but your instincts tell you another it is your instincts you must listen to. Deep down you already know the answers to whatever questions you have been asking of yourself, so calm your mind and let the wisdom come through."}, {"text": "Get to the point quickly today. If you waste time skirting around an issue, maybe because you don\u2019t want to hurt someone\u2019s feelings, you could find you have run out of time and missed an opportunity. As a fire sign you know how to think and act fast."}, {"text": "Today and over the weekend your one and only business should be to relax and take things easy. The early part of next week is going to be extremely busy, so pace yourself sensibly now and don\u2019t be tempted to start anything new."}, {"text": "Make sure you take your earphones with you if you are out and about today because there will be a lot of excess noise you need to cut out. Sob stories of one sort or another will come at you from every direction. Don\u2019t listen to any of them."}, {"text": "If there is something you think a friend or relative needs to know about then inform them immediately. The longer you leave it the harder it will be to persuade them that it isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. Use your way with words to soothe their fears."}, {"text": "You enjoy a challenge, and that\u2019s good, but you will need to remind yourself every now and again that some challenges are more important than others. What is it that inspires you to give of your best, each and every day? Make that the focus of your existence."}, {"text": "Things could get a bit tense today and if you are your usual outspoken self you could easily make matters worse by saying too much. It may be tough to keep your tongue behind your teeth but on this occasion it\u2019s essential, so give it a try."}, {"text": "Some people always look on the dark side of life \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if they enjoy it \u2013 but you are not one of them. The more those around you find fault with the world the more you should point out what a marvellous place it really is."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let others spoil your positive mood this weekend. The planets warn that you are likely to meet people who look at life in rigid terms of dark and light, but you don\u2019t have to go down that route with them. Misery doesn\u2019t deserve company."}, {"text": "Minor doubts seem to be annoying you at the moment and that is to be expected as the sun is now moving through the most sensitive area of your chart. You don\u2019t have to give in to them though. You have a thousand reasons to be cheerful."}, {"text": "As mind planet Mercury comes under pressure this weekend you could find that your imagination plays tricks on you. Keep telling yourself that however dark the situation may seem it is nothing more than a temporary absence of light \u2013 and it will return."}, {"text": "You rarely go out of your way to draw attention to yourself and you are strongly advised not to change now. Adopt a low profile this weekend and let others get caught up in the back and forth of everyday life \u2013 you can happily live without it."}, {"text": "Before taking up an offer of some kind this weekend you are advised to look into the situation in a little more depth. It could be that the offer is genuine but the planets warn that hidden forces are in play, forces that are best avoided."}, {"text": "Set your sights high this weekend and refuse to settle for second best. You may have to push yourself a bit harder than usual but since when has exerting yourself been a problem? No one gives as much as a Scorpio. No one can."}, {"text": "You must be honest with everyone over the next 48 hours, because if your words are later found out to be less than accurate you could find yourself in a lot of trouble. The people you will be dealing with demand the truth, so give it to them."}, {"text": "Once you start a task you like to get it finished quickly but the planets warn that what you are working on now is going to take longer than you expected. Don\u2019t just leave it half done because you will have to come back and complete it later on."}, {"text": "As one of the zodiac\u2019s fixed signs you have more staying power than most and that\u2019s good because you will have extra duties and chores to deal with over the next 48 hours. Work through them methodically and don\u2019t stop until they are done."}, {"text": "Pisces is such an adaptable sign that you can turn your hand to just about anything, but that does not mean you should try to do everything, at least not all in one go. Be selective in your activities this weekend. Do the important things first."}, {"text": "The most important thing for the coming year is that you keep yourself well informed about what\u2019s going on in the world. As a general rule, you will learn more if you dig deep into what the powers-that-be tell you must not be discussed."}, {"text": "If someone tries to belittle you or talk you down today you must be assertive in return. The danger is, if they get the idea they can say what they please about you they will take advantage of it. Give as good as you get, perhaps a bit more!"}, {"text": "A friend who has given you a lot of good advice of late will give you some more today and if you are smart you will act on what they tell you. You may not like what they are suggesting but you know it is for your own good."}, {"text": "If someone in a position of power expects you to do what they say for no better reason than because they are the ones saying it, they are going to be disappointed. Their authority means nothing to you \u2013 it\u2019s only the facts that you care about."}, {"text": "When the sun moves into your sign a few weeks from now you will look back and wonder why you worried so much about so many insignificant things. You don\u2019t have to let your anxieties ruin your life. Act as if you cannot lose, and you won\u2019t!"}, {"text": "Someone new in your social circle may be a lot of fun but don\u2019t let them know too much about you. There may be nothing at all to worry about but the planets warn it might be a mistake to share some of your more intimate details."}, {"text": "Because you are such a practical person others come to you expecting answers to their problems, and usually you are in a position to give them. Today though it will be you who requires advice. Who can you turn to in your moment of need?"}, {"text": "You seem to be working non-stop at the moment, but if you want to get on in the world then you have to make sacrifices. Don\u2019t worry, you will reap big rewards when the sun moves into the career area of your chart next month."}, {"text": "Yes, life seems a bit dull at the moment but you are approaching a more enjoyable phase, so cheer up and start making plans. You might also like to think about ways you can save a bit of money so you have more to invest later on."}, {"text": "You know what it is like to be popular but just lately it seems as if everyone wants to be your friend. Try asking yourself why so many strangers would like to get close to you. Could it be because they think they can prosper at your expense?"}, {"text": "The more time you spend planning now the easier it will be to move toward your goal later on. There are a number of ingredients that go into making a success of life, and preparation is right up there at the top of the list."}, {"text": "Yes, certain people do seem unnecessarily needy, but are you really going to turn your back on them? Of course not. Do what you can to assist friends and family members today, but find ways to encourage them to help themselves as well."}, {"text": "Recent events have no doubt taught you that you should never take anything in life for granted. There will be more upheavals over the next few days but you are in the right frame of mind to deal with them \u2013 and maybe profit from them too."}, {"text": "Never give up. That, in a nutshell, is the message of your birthday chart this year and if you take it to heart you will end up possessing what it is you most desire. Keep dreaming, keep believing and keep moving confidently towards your life\u2019s goal."}, {"text": "You may be in a minority of one at the moment, with no one on your side, but that doesn\u2019t worry you. You are most inspired when your back is to the wall and you will have a fun time today proving that you are still the best."}, {"text": "You may come into money over the next few days, but how long will you keep hold of it? If you go on a spending spree now you will regret it later in the week when you realize how much you have wasted \u2013 and how much you still need."}, {"text": "You are in no mood to settle for second best and with both the sun and Mercury lighting up your sign you can and you will be No. 1. Anyone who dares stand between you and your goal is unlikely to be standing for long!"}, {"text": "You must start the day, and the week, in a positive frame of mind, because the way you greet the world now will to a large extent determine how the world treats you. Remember, your mood does not depend on other people, it depends entirely on you."}, {"text": "It will pay you to keep an open mind over the next 24 hours because something is about to occur that challenges at least one, and maybe several, of your most basic assumptions. Today, the truth will be a lot stranger than fiction."}, {"text": "You can accomplish great things over the coming week, but you must not be impatient and try to push too soon or too hard. Success is as much about timing as it is about ambition, so wait for the right opening to present itself, then act."}, {"text": "You seem to be overreacting to events that at most other times would not bother you at all. Stand back from the daily grind for an hour or two and assess where it is you need to be heading. Then ignore the world and just go there."}, {"text": "Everyone has secrets and as a Scorpio you probably have more than your share, but today you need to be open about something that for the most part you have kept to yourself. Don\u2019t try to deny what excites and inspires you \u2013 revel in it."}, {"text": "Someone\u2019s self-importance is beginning to get on your nerves and it\u2019s quite likely that you will use your Sagittarian wit to bring them down a notch or two. That\u2019s fine but don\u2019t be too ruthless about it. You don\u2019t need another enemy."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to change something that has worked for you in the past but give it a bit more thought before you make the kind of break that cannot be mended. Is this really the right time? It may be best to put it off for a while."}, {"text": "The sun in the sympathetic sign of Gemini endows you with bags of energy, and plenty of fun ideas about how to use it. Anything of a creative nature, or related to travel, will work out well for you now, so get out there and be amazing."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart suggests that some kind of emotional upheaval is likely this week. That may not be what you want to hear but the fact is it has to happen \u2013 and you\u2019ll be better off for it."}, {"text": "You want to reach the top, but do you have a clear idea of what and where the top actually is? If you define your goals with care this year there is little doubt that you will reach them, but if your thinking is sloppy you may get nowhere fast."}, {"text": "The best way to deal with someone who badmouths you is to ignore them. It may not be the Aries way \u2013 you would prefer to make life difficult for them in some way \u2013 but on this occasion it\u2019s the sensible way. Don\u2019t waste your time on them."}, {"text": "You will get through so much work today that it may seem to others as if you are possessed. In reality you have merely come to the conclusion that you have been drifting along in low gear for too long \u2013 now it\u2019s time to speed things up."}, {"text": "You may have the world at your feet but don\u2019t take too much for granted or you could overlook something important. Business and financial affairs are a particular area of concern. In short, trust no one, not even those you have trusted before."}, {"text": "Focus your energy in a single direction and don\u2019t stop until you have created something truly worthwhile. With Mars in your sign there is nothing you cannot do, no task that is too much for you \u2013 but you must have a specific goal in mind."}, {"text": "You may seem happy on the outside but on the inside you dread the future. Why is that? It\u2019s because you have been foolish enough to listen to people whose outlook on life is far too negative. Be more selective in your choice of friends."}, {"text": "The tougher the challenge the more you like it and that\u2019s just as well because you are about to be confronted with a situation that will require every last ounce of your intelligence and staying power. When the going gets tough, Virgo gets going!"}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks you will compromise just because they ask you to obviously does not know you very well. If you are in a position of strength \u2013 and you are \u2013 why should you have to give ground to those who are weaker? You don\u2019t, and you won\u2019t."}, {"text": "You may be stuck in your ways in some areas but in others you are open to new ideas and one such idea will spur you into action today. Don\u2019t worry that more traditional types might disapprove \u2013 you quite enjoy playing the villain."}, {"text": "There are so many pretty things you want to possess but cannot afford, so what do you do? Well, you either earn more or you spend less. Start looking around for ways to boost your income. The more you want the harder you need to work."}, {"text": "There is no point making a big deal of something that is of only minor importance in the greater scheme of things. Yes, some people can be so annoying that they deserve to be put in their place, but let others do it \u2013 your time is precious."}, {"text": "The reason a certain person resents you is because your strength of purpose makes them look bad. The fact that you have a clear idea of what is right and what is wrong shows up the lack of depth in their own thinking. Show it up some more today."}, {"text": "Everything you do over the next few days will work out better than expected, which is nice, and everything friends and colleagues say about you will boost your confidence, which is even nicer. Do you deserve so much praise? Of course you do!"}, {"text": "It\u2019s easy to let other people make decisions for you, not least because it absolves you from blame if things go wrong, but that won\u2019t do any more. It\u2019s time to step up and take full responsibility for your choices, your aims and your ambitions. Own them."}, {"text": "You need a bit more adventure in your life and have every intention of getting it. Others may be amazed at how quickly you are able to change direction but for you it\u2019s so easy \u2013 you just follow your instincts and give your new aim your all."}, {"text": "You need to make sure you stay focused on money matters and business issues over the next few days. There may be more interesting things you would rather be doing but there is a lot of stake at the moment, so don\u2019t let your mind wander."}, {"text": "You have plenty of good ideas buzzing around that big brain of yours but what are you going to do with them all? You can start by getting them in some sort of order. Having a hierarchy of aims will help you turn dreams into realities."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your precious time thinking about all the things you did wrong in the past \u2013 the future starts here, right now, at this specific moment in time. And don\u2019t make too many detailed plans either. For best results just follow your instincts."}, {"text": "There are no limits to what you can do now, especially if you do them in the company of people who share your way of looking at life, so get up and get at them Leo and don\u2019t stop until you are king of the jungle again."}, {"text": "The sun in Gemini at this time of year makes you intensely ambitious but you must at all times remember there are limits to what you can hope to achieve. Focus on what comes naturally to you and don\u2019t push yourself in unfamiliar directions."}, {"text": "No doubt there are many things you would like to say about your current situation but a little voice in the back of your head is telling you to keep quiet for the time being. This is a time to have fun, not a time to get angry."}, {"text": "If you need assistance of a financial nature then speak up and let those who may be able to help you know what it is you require. There is every possibility that they will find ways to assist you, though they will of course want something in return."}, {"text": "Partners and loved ones have plenty to say for themselves at the moment and while at times it may get a bit tedious at least you know which way they are leaning \u2013 making it easier for you to influence their thinking in ways that benefit you."}, {"text": "You think you know better than everyone else, and most likely you do, but if you expect others to go along with your plans simply because they are logical then you must prepare to be disappointed. Logic has nothing to do with it."}, {"text": "You may be able to beat your rivals at just about anything but that does not mean you have to beat them. The message of the stars today is that you need to bring your aims and their aims into some form of alignment. You need each other."}, {"text": "Even a Pisces needs a helping hand once in a while and you may have to ask a friend or a family member for some assistance today. Don\u2019t feel bad about it, it\u2019s not a sign of failure. Let them help you like you always help others."}, {"text": "You may be limited in what you can do in the world at large over the coming 12 months, but your imagination will know no such bounds, so let your dreams guide you and before you know it your fantasies will have become solid realities."}, {"text": "An invitation of some kind will sound tempting, and being a fun sort of person you will put work on hold and have a good time. Don\u2019t forget though that work can be fun too \u2013 the definition of \u201cfun\u201d is pretty much what you choose to make it."}, {"text": "If you start looking at your money situation with a more serious eye this weekend you should be able to find ways to cut costs and improve your cash-flow situation. Remember, not everything that\u2019s worth having in life needs to be bought."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to do anything special over the next 48 hours, just be yourself and enjoy what the universe brings your way. At this time of year especially, the more you think you deserve good things in your life the more you will get them."}, {"text": "You may not be your usual carefree self this weekend \u2013 in fact you may seem a bit down \u2013 but the less time and energy you spend socializing the more will be available to get the personal side of your life back in shape \u2013 and it seems to need it!"}, {"text": "If there are things in your life that you are not 100 per cent happy about then change them. Yes, it really is that simple. Moaning about what\u2019s gone wrong may bring short-term relief but it\u2019s what you actually choose to do that will make a difference."}, {"text": "You will be under a lot of scrutiny over the next few days, and the way you deal with pressure will make a big difference to how people in positions of power treat you in future. Stay calm and deal with challenges in a rational and logical manner."}, {"text": "You should be a lot more confident now the sun is moving through the most adventurous area of your chart. You should also recognize that many of the things you have been worrying about these past few weeks are really not worth the effort."}, {"text": "A more realistic approach to your long-term aims is a must, or you may end up disenchanted that you have accomplished so little. You are making progress, but to begin with the steps you take must be small. Learn to walk before you start running."}, {"text": "It may seem unfair that others get a say in what you are doing, and you get no say at all in what they are doing, but that\u2019s just the way it is at the moment. Letting them take control for a while could actually do you some good."}, {"text": "That pile of work that is sitting in front of you won\u2019t shift itself, so get stuck in and don\u2019t take a break until you can see you are making progress. Your physical energy levels will respond to your mental desire to get on top of your chores."}, {"text": "Why are you still feeling sorry for yourself? At this time of year, with the sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart, it\u2019s a criminal waste to give in to self-pity. There is so much you can achieve now Aquarius, so get your act together!"}, {"text": "No one cares more than a Pisces, but sometimes you can care too much and leave yourself open to manipulation by people who care only about their own selfish desires. What happens this weekend will toughen you up a bit. Reality is a great teacher."}, {"text": "There are no quick fixes or shortcuts. Whatever it is you hope to accomplish over the coming 12 months you must have a proper plan and you must apply yourself every moment of every day. You build success, you don\u2019t just seize it."}, {"text": "Pay no heed to those who say you should keep your opinions to yourself. If you have something to say then say it and be prepared to live with the consequences, which, despite others\u2019 warnings, are unlikely to bother you to any great extent."}, {"text": "Make allowances for people who are not as creative or original as you and don\u2019t lose your temper if they fail to live up to your exacting standards. If everyone could do what you do then you wouldn\u2019t be so special, would you?"}, {"text": "As Mercury, your ruler, opposes Jupiter today it\u2019s quite likely you will have second thoughts about something which only a short time ago you loved the idea of. But is it really you who is having those thoughts, or is someone else putting them into your mind?"}, {"text": "Something that belongs in the past is still bothering you and you won\u2019t be able to move on to new and more exciting things until you get over it. Whatever it happens to be you finally need to accept that it is over and done with. Never look back."}, {"text": "You are not the sort to be affected by criticism \u2013 usually you don\u2019t even notice it \u2013 but something a friend or colleague said recently is still gnawing at you. It could be because they have a point. Don\u2019t be afraid to question your own behaviour."}, {"text": "Why are you taking so much notice of what other people say and so little notice of what your own senses tell you? You need to trust yourself more Virgo. You need to let that small voice inside you come through and guide you. It knows the answers."}, {"text": "You prefer situations where you know what the outcome is likely to be, but now you have no idea what is going to happen next and it worries you a bit. Relax. Your fears are unfounded. The planets indicate everything is going to be fine."}, {"text": "Whatever else you do today you must not manipulate the facts of a situation to suit your own purposes. Rivals are watching you closely in the hope that you will do something unethical which they can use against you. Don\u2019t make it easy for them."}, {"text": "The more others say you should trust them the more you must make sure you know what they are up to. Cosmic activity across the financial axis of your chart warns you may be targeted by those who think you are an easy touch."}, {"text": "Deal with problems one at a time today and don\u2019t worry if you cannot get through as much work as you had planned. There is still plenty of time to tackle the backlog of jobs that have been stacking up \u2013 it\u2019s a time management issue, nothing more."}, {"text": "It may be possible to just take what you want today but you need to realize that if it\u2019s okay for you to do that then it\u2019s okay for other people to take from you as well. A more civilized approach would be to negotiate a deal so everyone wins."}, {"text": "A friend or family member seems a bit low emotionally and mentally at the moment and you should make it your job to cheer them up. Not only will they feel better for it but you will benefit too. Helping people always lifts your spirits."}, {"text": "You will set out to do something completely different with your life over the coming year. As far as you are concerned you have been a bit too predictable for a bit too long and now you want remind the world that Gemini should never be taken for granted."}, {"text": "If you push yourself a little bit harder than you were planning to this weekend your efforts could pay off in a big way. That applies to your private life as well as your work. Put yourself out for loved ones and they will love you all the more."}, {"text": "In one area you will gain a lot today but in another area you will lose about the same amount. But the area in which you gain is much more important than the area in which you lose, so overall you will be on the winning side."}, {"text": "Resist the urge to argue with someone who is being controversial for the fun of it. As a rule you enjoy a good debate but on this occasion it\u2019s not worth the effort. Save your persuasive skills for situations, and people, that matter."}, {"text": "Try not to let someone\u2019s negative comments get you down this weekend. It\u2019s true that you\u2019re not perfect but so what? You\u2019ve made a few mistakes, just like everyone else, but unlike some people you could name you have learnt from them."}, {"text": "You should know by now that a certain person delights in saying things that get a reaction. You should also know that if you rise to the bait the situation could spin out of control, so close your ears to them and refuse to get involved."}, {"text": "You may have faith in your own abilities but it seems that a colleague is yet to be convinced that you can be trusted with a project of some importance. Expect to be tested this weekend. Stay calm and you will soon win them round."}, {"text": "It is inevitable that some of your opinions will upset those of a delicate disposition, but that is not a good enough reason to tone them down. The truth is the truth and you have a duty, as well as a right, to call it as you see it."}, {"text": "Money matters are under challenging stars at the moment and if you must splash the cash make sure you get good value for what you buy. Better still, wait to see what Monday\u2019s new moon brings your way. You may not have to splash out after all."}, {"text": "You have never been good at taking orders and have no intention of changing your ways now. Someone who thinks they can tell you to do this and do that will be on the receiving end of some telling themselves \u2013 and the language won\u2019t be pretty!"}, {"text": "By all means enjoy the good things in life but in doing so try not to deny another person the things that they enjoy. You actually have plenty in common and if you highlight those areas you may find that sharing good things doubles their pleasure."}, {"text": "By all means act tough this weekend. Give others the impression that if they mess with you they will regret it. They will get the message and rethink what they were planning to do. People are rarely as brave as they first make out."}, {"text": "What a friend tells you today may sound confusing but you are advised to listen and work out what it is they are trying to say. If you let their words go in one ear and come out the other you could miss out on something good."}, {"text": "You will need to stand up for yourself a lot more over the coming year than you did over the previous 12 months. Let everyone know that you won\u2019t be pushed around, then do a bit of pushing of your own. They\u2019ll get the message."}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to let other people tell you what to do, and you are not about to start now. If someone demands that you do something one way today you will take great delight in doing it the opposite way!"}, {"text": "The sun in the main financial area of your chart will open up new money-making possibilities, but you need to be careful which of them you choose to pursue. The approaching eclipse could punish you if you are too reckless."}, {"text": "You seem to be building up to something big, something that will give the kind of meaning to your life that seems to have been lacking of late. One way or another you will be at the cenrer of things \u2013 hopefully for a good reason!"}, {"text": "Take a look back over the first few months of the year and be honest with yourself about what you have succeeded at and what, so far, has been a failure. All experience is good experience, so learn from it and then do even better."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t find it hard to show your adventurous side today but if you go too far you risk alienating people who might be able to help you. You say you don\u2019t need their help? That may be true now, but it won\u2019t be true later on."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s transit of the career area of your chart means you need to get serious about your long-term ambitions. Take time out of your busy schedule to look again at what you are hoping to accomplish \u2013 then make the necessary adjustments."}, {"text": "Your outlook is extremely bright at the moment, so why do you seem so determined to see only doom and gloom? There are so many positive things going on in your world that there is really no excuse for such a negative attitude."}, {"text": "You rarely let other people know what is going on in your head, still less in your heart, and that kind of secrecy should work well for you over the next 24 hours. The less your rivals know about your potential weak spots the better."}, {"text": "Partnerships and relationships have been under good stars of late, but over the next few days tensions will start to rise again and it may be hard to keep things amicable. That\u2019s okay. Think of it as a necessary period of emotional cleansing."}, {"text": "Just because you have strong opinions on certain subjects does not mean you have to be open about them, still less try to force others to agree with you. On the work front especially, let colleagues do their own thing in their own way."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to do anything special to earn favour with partners and loved ones and colleagues. Just be yourself and they will be happy with that. Also, be ready to take advantage of new opportunities \u2013 because they\u2019re on the way now."}, {"text": "This could be one of those frustrating days where just about everyone seems determined to disagree with just about everything you say. Don\u2019t bother arguing with them \u2013 in fact let them spout off all they want. Their own words will condemn them."}, {"text": "Not only is there a new moon on your birthday but Venus, planet of love, and Pluto, planet of passion, are well aligned too. What does that mean in everyday words? It means the universe will grant you whatever it is that your heart desires."}, {"text": "There is enough room in the world, and in your own life, for all shades of opinion, so don\u2019t lose your cool if someone says something you don\u2019t approve of. Agree to disagree and leave it at that. There are still plenty of things you have in common."}, {"text": "Make a decision and stick with it. The more certain people try to get you to change your mind today the more stubborn you must be. If you are sure of your ground \u2013 and you are \u2013 then nothing else matters. Be big and bold enough to trust yourself."}, {"text": "A new moon in your sign indicates that if you get your act together and get cracking on a new plan or project the results will be little short of amazing. This is your time of year, so do what you want to do and do it with style."}, {"text": "If you speak your mind today you won\u2019t worry in the slightest if your words offend certain people. Having said which, if you keep your opinions to yourself you won\u2019t waste them on people who are too stupid to understand. It\u2019s your call."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon will give you the courage and the confidence to take a few risks, which in turn will make success more likely. Don\u2019t be secretive about your aims \u2013 if you are open and honest you will get a huge amount of support."}, {"text": "Sometimes you do more for other people than you do for yourself, but cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your position in the world will encourage you to put your own interests first. Treat yourself to whatever it is that your heart desires."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be content to sit back and let life come to you today. With a new moon highlighting the most adventurous area of your chart you will be out there making things happen. The world is your playground Libra \u2013 enjoy it to the full."}, {"text": "This is a good time to start something new but before you do you must make sure it is going to be something to which you can commit on a long-term basis. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time and energy, so ask yourself: is it worth it?"}, {"text": "You may honestly believe that a friend or colleague is up to no good but can you be certain? The planets warn it may be you who has got the wrong end of the stick \u2013 and if you make a big scene you could end up getting beaten with it!"}, {"text": "No matter how much others may tell you to pace yourself today you won\u2019t listen to them. You are desperate to get out into the world and prove yourself and if that means testing your limits of physical and mental endurance then so be it!"}, {"text": "If you want something enough you can always find a way to get it, and with today\u2019s new moon taking place in the most dynamic area of your chart success is no longer a matter of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d. Go all out to prove you are the best."}, {"text": "You would never turn your back on those who need assistance, and that\u2019s good, but you need to be aware of the fact that some of the people who say only you can help them are pulling your emotional strings. Don\u2019t be a soft touch Pisces."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you think for yourself and don\u2019t follow a particular opinion or belief just because most other people are doing so. You may find yourself swimming against the tide of public opinion but public opinion isn\u2019t always right."}, {"text": "Although you are usually the life and soul of the party you will want to be on your own today. It may annoy some people that you suddenly cut yourself off from contact but you need to get your head together and you need to do it now."}, {"text": "Keep doing what you are doing and ignore those who say you should be doing something else. According to the planets it will be a complete waste of time trying to explain your motives, so just get on with it and accept the consequences."}, {"text": "You may have to fight to get yourself noticed today but that\u2019s okay. You are one of those people who enjoys a challenge and when you win \u2013 and you will win \u2013 you will also enjoy the rewards it brings, some of which may be financial."}, {"text": "Leave behind whatever issues your mind has been wrestling with these past few weeks and march confidently into the future. What you did, or did not do, yesterday will have no effect on what you do today or tomorrow, so stop worrying and start living!"}, {"text": "If you go out of your way to make friends with someone who is very different to you in terms of personality you may be surprised to find you hit it off. Opposites do attract and, on this occasion, they will not only attract but also complement one another."}, {"text": "You may think you can complete a certain task on your own, but you will complete it faster, and to a higher standard, if you get assistance. Even if you are the best at what you do there is still room for improvement \u2013 and always will be."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have been pushing yourself way too hard and need to take a break. Take it now, not later. And make sure it is a proper break too, not one where you end up working on something else. Switch off completely."}, {"text": "Start thinking about what changes you would like to make in the very near future. Yes, of course, you make changes all the time but as mind planet Mercury moves in your favour today your outlook will expand and your ambitions will expand too."}, {"text": "Anyone who tries to play games with you is sure to regret it. You are in no mood for trivial pursuits and you won\u2019t hesitate to let others know. As far as you are concerned they can do one of two things: assist or get out of your way."}, {"text": "Try not to take what you hear from friends and family members too seriously today because almost certainly you are hearing only half the story. Also, act on the assumption that others may be deliberately making things look worse than they are."}, {"text": "Give yourself plenty of time to finish whatever it is you are currently working on. You may think you have to rush through it to meet a deadline but you don\u2019t, not least because it\u2019s a deadline that was imposed on you rather than one you chose for yourself."}, {"text": "Take pleasure in what you do today, even if it\u2019s an activity you did not want to get involved with. Happiness is a state of mind, as is success, and if you can get your head to a good place then everything else will be good for you too."}, {"text": "If you use your brain this year you will come to some interesting conclusions about what is going on in the world and what you should do about it. Those conclusions will be both enlightening and enriching. Once you know what\u2019s going on you can profit from it."}, {"text": "Although you may be required to put other people\u2019s needs ahead of your own today you won\u2019t lose out. On the contrary, the fact that you are willing to make sacrifices, however small, for others means you will get something good in return."}, {"text": "Ideas will come thick and fast today and you are advised to carry a pen and a piece of paper with you wherever you go so you can jot them down before you forget them. Even your big brain will be hard-pressed to remember them all."}, {"text": "Business activities are under excellent stars at the moment and even if you lose money in one direction you will make up for it in another. You see openings quicker than most other people and if you act on them fast you could even get rich."}, {"text": "What is the most important thing you could be doing right now? Identify it and then do it to the exclusion of everything else. Mind planet Mercury, now in your sign, will make sure that everything runs smoothly and according to plan."}, {"text": "There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. The planets indicate that everything will work out for the best if you stay calm and refuse to let fear get the better of you. Your imagination should be your servant, not your master."}, {"text": "Why is everyone so friendly at the moment? Could people you don\u2019t really trust be up to no good? Well, it\u2019s possible, of course, but the planets suggest that even those you have clashed with in the past now genuinely want to be your friends."}, {"text": "There is no need to get suspicious if someone in a position of authority showers you with praise over the next 24 hours \u2013 they really do think you are special. Work out what it is you have done to please them, then do it some more."}, {"text": "If you have been thinking about taking a vacation then now is the time to get serious about your plans. Decide where you want to go and what you want to do and then book that ticket. Don\u2019t hesitate \u2013 let your instincts guide you."}, {"text": "It is now too late to back out of something you were never completely sure about but agreed to go along with for the sake of an easy life. If the consequences don\u2019t suit you then you have no one but yourself to blame. Next time, just say \u201cno\u201d"}, {"text": "If there is something you need from a friend \u2013 a favour, a loan, or even a hug \u2013 come right out and ask for it. Chances are they will give it to you with no questions asked. They want to give it as much as you want to have it."}, {"text": "If you need to catch up and then get ahead on the work front this is the day to make your play. You may not have any more energy than usual but you will use your time in a far more effective way. Work smarter, not harder."}, {"text": "You may need to get tough with someone you have dealings with today but that\u2019s okay \u2013 they will respond well to a more forthright approach. It\u2019s not often you crack the whip but when you do others are left in no doubt that you mean it."}, {"text": "The future is what you choose to make of it and with Jupiter strong on your birthday this year you can create a brand new story for yourself. Draw an imaginary line in front of you, then step over it and keep moving forward without looking back."}, {"text": "Whatever else you do today make sure you enjoy yourself. Whatever tests fate sends your way you should know that you have what it takes to effectively deal with them. You\u2019re an Aries, you enjoy a challenge, and you will certainly be challenged today."}, {"text": "The best way to deal with people who take themselves too seriously is to make fun of them. It\u2019s unlikely to make you any new friends, of course, but with any luck it will help them realize that being pompous is rarely a good idea."}, {"text": "Wherever you go and whatever you do today the omens are good that you will achieve something worthwhile. The aura of self-assurance you project will attract to you people who can assist you in your quest to be someone worthy of respect."}, {"text": "If you think lucky you will be lucky \u2013 yes, it\u2019s really that simple. Cosmic activity in and around your sign suggests that the more you believe in yourself the more the universe will provide you with opportunities to express the creative side of your nature."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t jump to conclusions over the next 24 hours or the results could be painful, for you at least. You may have fixed ideas about what motivates certain people but you cannot be sure. You have many talents but reading minds isn\u2019t one of them."}, {"text": "Not everyone shares your concerns for what is going on in the world and the more you try to convince them the more you will turn them off. If you have a mission you want to pursue then do so, but don\u2019t expect everyone else to agree."}, {"text": "Libra is a cardinal sign and ambitious by nature, but ambition alone won\u2019t get you to where you most want to be. If you can add imagination and courage to the mix over the next few days though the results could be interesting, maybe even magical."}, {"text": "Some Scorpios prefer their own company, while others are sociable in the extreme, but whichever category you fall into you must now allow yourself to be more open to other people\u2019s ideas, and that means interacting with the world around you."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you are on the move and that you don\u2019t allow anything to slow you down. Jupiter in your sign makes possible the kind of efforts that most people are simply not capable of producing. But you\u2019re not most people, you\u2019re special."}, {"text": "You tend to always be on your guard but you will need to be a little more trusting today, especially when dealing with people who share your outlook on life. Alone, there is only so much you can do. Together, you can change the world."}, {"text": "Your personality may be \u201cfixed\u201d in many ways but that does not mean you are not capable of adapting, and you will need to try new ways of doing things over the next few days. Learn from the past by all means but don\u2019t be constrained by it."}, {"text": "Ignore those who say you should be taking life more seriously \u2013 on the contrary, the more you laugh and enjoy what\u2019s going on around you the more you will accomplish. Always have something to look forward to, and always have something to smile about."}, {"text": "The future you envisage for yourself is the future you will get. Your mind is a more powerful tool than you realize and there will be times this year when your thoughts become realities as if by some sort of magic. Think the unthinkable, and do it!"}, {"text": "Even your rivals will admire the way you deal with tough situations today. There is something about the Aries nature that refuses to know when it is beaten and because of that you rarely are. If you could bottle that talent you would make a fortune!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t listen to those who say you should lower your sights and aim for a target that is within your natural range. The whole point of stretching yourself is that you expand your limits \u2013 that what was difficult for you before now comes easy. Go for it Taurus!"}, {"text": "If the old ways of doing things no longer work for you then change them. That may sound ridiculously easy but, of course, it is actually quite hard and what happens today and over the weekend will challenge you like never before. You\u2019ll love it."}, {"text": "Uranus, planet of the unexpected, links with Mercury in your sign today, so it is quite likely that you will experience some kind of breakthrough on a mental level. Your new way of looking at the world will answer many of the questions you have been asking."}, {"text": "You will have to do something today that does not come naturally but you know you cannot just walk away from it. Plan ahead as best you can, then put your heart and soul into making it a success. You may surprise yourself by what you can do."}, {"text": "If a friend suggests something today that you think is mad then, of course, your first reaction will be to have nothing to do with it. Having given it some thought though you may decide it\u2019s worth a shot. What have you got to lose?"}, {"text": "A good deed you did in the recent past will be repaid in full today. You don\u2019t expect anything in return, of course, but the universe always pays its debts \u2013 which is maybe something you should think about the next time you consider doing a bad deed!"}, {"text": "Something you are asked to do today could be a bit embarrassing but if you don\u2019t think about it and just do it then it won\u2019t be so bad. Scorpios in general tend to be pretty robust, which on occasions like this can work in your favour."}, {"text": "It is important that you say the right things, especially when dealing with people who are in a position to make you rich or make you poor. You must not lie to them, of course, but you can, and you should, put a positive spin on your words."}, {"text": "With Mercury, planet of the mind, linked to Uranus, planet of genius, today there is every chance that you will come up with an idea that never occurred to you before. Don\u2019t just leave it as an idea though \u2013 use it to improve your position in life."}, {"text": "You want to take a risk of some kind but you worry that if you do you could leave yourself open to forces that would like to destroy you. Since when have you been the sort to play it safe? Life is an adventure or it is nothing."}, {"text": "With both Mercury and Mars moving in your favour at the moment you don\u2019t lack for confidence, and with changes planet Uranus getting in on the act today you won\u2019t hesitate to try something new. Your belief in yourself can be quite intimidating Pisces!"}, {"text": "There will be times when you go all out to win fame and fortune, and times when you cannot be bothered to interact with the world at all. You could try to find a midway point but it\u2019s unlikely to happen \u2013 you enjoy bouncing back and forth between extremes."}, {"text": "This is potentially a great weekend for social activities, especially those that require you to get out into the world. If you are in the market for love you may get lucky. If you are already in love your relationship will move to a much higher level."}, {"text": "The overall emphasis of your stars may be on money matters now but don\u2019t forget there are other things in your life that need seeing to. For starters, what, and who, are you going to spend all that money on in the near future?"}, {"text": "As Venus moves into your sign today you should take life at a more tranquil pace. You don\u2019t have to rush here, there and everywhere at top speed \u2013 in fact you don\u2019t have to rush at all. What is meant to happen will happen at just the right time."}, {"text": "Something you have spent many hours, if not days, worrying about is actually of no importance at all and what occurs this weekend will bring that fact home to you in ways that cannot be denied. You worry too much Cancer. As always."}, {"text": "Spend time with friends and colleagues who share your outlook on life, and your special brand of humour. No matter how serious things may be in the world at large you can always find something to laugh about, and it feels great when you don\u2019t laugh alone."}, {"text": "Just because someone occupies a position of authority does not mean you have to do everything they say. If you feel they are not being completely honest or forthright then make it your business to say so \u2013 but not in a confrontational sort of way."}, {"text": "You want to be friends with everyone \u2013 and everyone wants to be friends with you. As Venus, your ruler, moves into your fellow air sign of Gemini this weekend you will find yourself drawn to people who are different in some way. Opposites attract."}, {"text": "As Venus moves into the wealth area of your chart this weekend you could get lucky with money, but you could also be far too extravagant and see any gains you make wasted. For every dollar you make, send 50 cents straight to the bank!"}, {"text": "Relationships are under good stars over the next 48 hours, so be open to people who approach you and don\u2019t think they want to get to know you for selfish reasons. Even if they do you will benefit too, maybe in ways you did not expect."}, {"text": "There is no reason to push yourself too hard today, or tomorrow come to that. Cosmic activity in the work and wellbeing area of your chart urges you to slow down and enjoy the things that life brings your way. The less you do for yourself the better."}, {"text": "Life is good and getting better by the minute and with Venus now joining the sun in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart you won\u2019t put a foot wrong this weekend. Your star is very much on the rise, so make an effort to shine!"}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need to go over the top and do crazy things to impress people, either at home or at work, you just need to be yourself and do what you always do. Believe it or not, others admire you and look up to you just as you are."}, {"text": "Your faith in your own abilities reached new heights over the previous 12 months, and with good reason. Now you can push on and put yourself to the test even more, confident that whatever life throws at you can be turned to your long-term advantage."}, {"text": "Are you a glass half full or a glass half empty sort of Aries? If it\u2019s the latter and you think that life is tough, then consider this: Somewhere in the region of six billion of your fellow human beings would happily change places with you \u2013 so cheer up!"}, {"text": "If there is something you have been wanting to say for ages but never quite got around to putting into words, then get ready \u2013 you will get the chance to make your thoughts known over the next 24 hours. Don\u2019t hold back. Tell others what they need to hear."}, {"text": "You may need to remind yourself today that you have dreams and aspirations of your own and you cannot afford to spend all your time fixing things for other people. Be assertive, be ambitious and be ready to say \u201cno\u201d when you are asked to help out yet again."}, {"text": "You may have lost the desire to finish a project of some kind, but that\u2019s okay. If your heart isn\u2019t in it then even if you did get it done it probably would not be up to standard, so let it go and focus on something more worthy of your talents."}, {"text": "Joint activities are under good stars now and if you are called on to work as part of a team over the next few days you will not only have a good time but will enhance your reputation as well. The more you co-operate the more you will thrive."}, {"text": "What you want to do and what people in positions of authority expect you to do may be two entirely different things, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. There are ways you can merge your aims with the aims of those who are handing out the orders."}, {"text": "You will want to be on the move today but events may force you to stay where you are. Yes, it\u2019s frustrating, but if you are smart you will find creative ways to make it work in your favour. Be patient \u2013 you\u2019ll be on the move again soon."}, {"text": "Keep your thoughts to yourself today, especially if they are the kind of thoughts that could cause ill feeling if the wrong people get to hear of them. You probably don\u2019t care what others think, of course, but this is not the time to stir things up."}, {"text": "Someone you have feelings for may be unable to meet up with you today, which will be disappointing, but don\u2019t make a big deal of it. You will still have plenty of opportunities to have fun together over the next few weeks, so accept it and keep smiling."}, {"text": "You will have a great deal of energy at your disposal over the next few days, but don\u2019t use it all up in one go. Both at home and at work try moving at a more moderate pace, one that takes you places without too much physical exertion."}, {"text": "Say what you need to say as plainly and simply as you know how. It may seem to some people as if you are lacking in empathy but the most important thing now is that they get the message quickly and fully. Their feelings are of secondary importance."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let your personal feelings get in the way of common sense today. You may be tempted to assure friends and loved ones that nothing bad is going to happen, but that will only be true if you all face up to the facts and do what is necessary."}, {"text": "Jupiter and Saturn are both strong on your birthday this year, which suggests that what you gain and what you lose will cancel each other out. Remember though that attitude is everything \u2013 winning and losing can be equally enjoyable, if you want them to be."}, {"text": "Try not to criticize other people if, because of their stupidity, you have to make last-minute changes to a plan you thought was done and dusted. With the sun in the social area of your chart under pressure today it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get a fair hearing."}, {"text": "Just because other people are happy to take risks today does not mean you have to take them, too. In fact, if you follow a more cautious line over the next 24 hours you could benefit from their mistakes, of which there will be plenty."}, {"text": "The sun in your sign may give the impression that there are no restrictions and that you can do as you please, but it isn\u2019t true. Watch your step today, and tomorrow, and don\u2019t tempt fate by doing things that could end painfully rather than gainfully."}, {"text": "A little bit of what you fancy will do you a lot of good, but make sure it is only a little bit. The planets warn if you take too much you will come to regret your greed before the day is done. Moderation in all things is essential."}, {"text": "The sun, your ruler, is at odds with both Saturn and Jupiter as the new week begins, a clear warning that if you try to cut corners or do things on the cheap you will lose far more than you gain in the long-term \u2013 so do it right."}, {"text": "Dealings with authority figures could get a bit stressful today, so promise yourself now that you won\u2019t overreact if they say or do things that you don\u2019t agree with. Keep a low profile and refuse to get angry, with them or with yourself."}, {"text": "While the sun in Gemini at this time of year encourages you to be adventurous, other aspects warn that you must also respect your natural limits. One of those limits is that you need loved ones close to you, so don\u2019t be foolish and push them away."}, {"text": "You must not rush what you are working on, no matter how much others may try to hurry you along. If a job is worth doing then it is worth doing well, so take your time. Despite what some people might say you are not working against the clock."}, {"text": "Take care to avoid any kind of fight or feud. Generally speaking you enjoy being put to the test but the planets warn that if you take on a rival today you will almost certainly end up on the losing side, which won\u2019t be good for your ego."}, {"text": "If your energy wanes alarmingly today take the message and slow right down. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart means you need to rest both your body and your mind, not least because there are some major challenges coming up soon."}, {"text": "Do you just have fun today, or do you get serious and get stuck in to that backlog of work-related jobs you still have to do? Make it the latter. The sooner you get started the sooner you will be finished \u2013 and then it will be fun time again."}, {"text": "Do everything in your power to stay on the good side of loved ones today. The planets warn that the very last thing you want to do now is open up old wounds, so put the past out of your mind and work together toward a brighter future."}, {"text": "The fact that you hear a voice in your head telling you what to do does not mean you are mad. On the contrary, you have never been more sane and that voice is the \u201chigher\u201d you trying to guide you in the right direction. Listen to it, then act."}, {"text": "You must start taking a more positive view of the future. For some strange reason you have got it into your head that certain things are no longer worth fighting for when, in fact, courage and action are needed more than ever. You\u2019re a leader Aries \u2013 so lead!"}, {"text": "If you can just bring yourself to accept that nothing stays the same forever then the next few days could be truly enlightening. You cannot hold back the tide and you cannot stop the changes that are coming your way. But you can embrace them."}, {"text": "What does not destroy you is sure to make you stronger, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and get back out there and fight. Yes, your rivals are powerful, and yes, the odds are stacked against you \u2013 but that will make it more satisfying when you triumph."}, {"text": "There have been a number of times of late when you wished you were some place else, but you came through your trials and tribulations unscathed and now you are almost ready to take on the world. But note that word \u201calmost\u201d. You still have some preparation to do."}, {"text": "If your instincts tell you to be careful you must not ignore them. You may think you can take risks and get away with them, and maybe you can, but it could take just one little slip up to make you look silly \u2013 and you hate looking silly!"}, {"text": "You can see which way the cosmic winds are blowing and if you are quick and brave and resourceful you can latch on to them and get them to blow you to the place where you most want to be. If you travel fast you will travel far."}, {"text": "Be careful what words you allow to pass your lips today because the planets warn you could go too far and say too much and regret it later in the month. Just because you know how to use words as a weapon does not mean you have to."}, {"text": "You may try to disguise your emotions and pretend that certain problems don\u2019t worry you but you won\u2019t fool many people, and certainly not those who know you well. You\u2019ve kept negative feelings bottled up inside for too long \u2013 let them out immediately."}, {"text": "You would never allow other people to limit your right to think and speak and act, so don\u2019t try to limit them. If you do there is sure to be a backlash and it may be hugely destructive. Causes always have consequences: not sometimes \u2013 always!"}, {"text": "You need to stop tormenting yourself with ridiculous fantasies about what might go wrong with something you are currently working on. The planets indicate that you are well on top of it, so why waste time on such negative thinking? Only you can answer that."}, {"text": "Your solar chart warns if you cut corners or break rules over the next few days the consequences won\u2019t be to your liking around the time the moon is full on the 17th. You don\u2019t need to resort to questionable tactics Aquarius \u2013 you\u2019re already a winner."}, {"text": "Are you feeling refreshed and relaxed Pisces? Let\u2019s hope so because there are some big challenges coming your way and you will need to be at your best to deal with them. Make no plans for the next few days. You\u2019ll be reacting to events, not initiating them."}, {"text": "According to your birthday chart you have been wasting time on trivialities when you should have been dealing with things of a more serious nature. Get your act together and get busy on something you will be remembered for well into the future."}, {"text": "Are you seeing your current situation as it is, or as you would like it to be? The planets warn you could easily slip into make-believe mode and be a bit too optimistic for your own good. You need to acknowledge reality, before reality turns on you."}, {"text": "Try to understand that the people you are dealing with are a lot more wary of you than you need be of them. They may look confident but beneath the surface they recognize that you are a force to be reckoned with. You need to recognize it, too."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t make excuses for either your own failings or the failings of other people. You know what needs to be done and you know that you need to get on with it soon, because time is about to speed up and leave the stragglers far behind."}, {"text": "You may be under the impression that you can get away with almost anything, but you also need to understand that until the sun moves into your sign on the 21st you cannot afford to make mistakes. If you do you will surely be punished for them."}, {"text": "Can you rely on what friends and family members tell you? Usually you can, of course, but the planets are aligned in such a way that you really must do your own research before taking any major decisions. You cannot rely on the words of others."}, {"text": "Even a Virgo needs to call a halt now and again, so slow down and give both your body and your brain time to recover from recent excursions. Don\u2019t think of it as time wasted, think of it as an investment in your health and future success."}, {"text": "Some of the people you work alongside may appear to be moving slowly but it could just as easily be you who is moving too fast. Chances are you will get more done today if you actually do less than usual. It\u2019s about quality, not quantity."}, {"text": "If someone gives you a hard time about what you\u2019ve been up to it can only be because they are jealous of your success. And so they should be. They could be a success too if they possessed your strength and staying power. But they don\u2019t, and never will."}, {"text": "Get routine matters out of the way as early in the day as possible because as the sun rises in the sky so your star will be on the rise as well. Creatively, the world will beat a path to your door. Romantically, your heart will be beating stronger than ever."}, {"text": "Yours is one of the more materialistic signs of the zodiac but today you will put money and possessions out of your mind and pursue a goal that means something to you on a personal, maybe even a spiritual, level. Only love carries over to the next life."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t lack for confidence today, but unless you temper it with a large dash of common sense you will end up doing too much soon and suffering for it. Set yourself targets that stretch you but are still within reach. Why set yourself up for failure?"}, {"text": "You may be eager to try new things but this is not a good time to take risks. That applies to the public side of your life, but even more so to your private affairs. Stay close to the people you love most in the world. Let them guide you."}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link on your birthday means you need to be honest with yourself about what you are capable of, so the goals you set yourself are genuinely within your reach. You also need to recognize that there is more to life than getting ahead and making money."}, {"text": "You may think you are smarter than someone in a position of authority, and maybe you are, but they have a lot more power than you, so don\u2019t get cocky and certainly don\u2019t say or do anything that might make them look bad \u2013 or you may regret it."}, {"text": "Some people you like and some people you don\u2019t and there is no reason why you should feel guilty about it. If those you have to deal with today are in some way not to your liking then do what you have to do and quickly move on."}, {"text": "If you make an effort you will accomplish a lot, but if you make too much of an effort you could damage yourself in some way, so get the balance right. As a general rule of thumb, if it no longer feels like fun then you\u2019re doing it wrong."}, {"text": "You will find it hard to put your feelings into words today but maybe that\u2019s no bad thing considering that some of your feelings are anything but positive. The planets warn if you say the wrong thing you could fall out with some dangerous people."}, {"text": "Old habits may be hard to break but break them you must if you are to make the most of your talents. One way might be to indulge a habit to such an extent that you quickly grow sick of it. It\u2019s an unconventional approach but it could work."}, {"text": "The only advice you need is that which comes from your own inner voice, so ignore those who are shouting that you should be doing this or you should be doing that and do what feels right to you. If you trust yourself today you won\u2019t go far wrong."}, {"text": "An anxiety you should have conquered long ago will make an unwelcome return today and this time you really must find a way to get past it. Face the matter head-on and refuse to be intimidated. You may discover it has no real hold over you at all."}, {"text": "You may look self-assured but the planets indicate you have serious doubts about what you are working on. Your best course of action for now is to ignore those doubts and carry on, but if they persist you may need to look at alternative options."}, {"text": "Focus on what comes easy to you over the next 24 hours and resist those who try to get you involved in things you don\u2019t know much about. Chances are they are scared to get involved themselves and want you to be the one to take the risks."}, {"text": "News you receive from afar may not be all that exciting but you will be delighted with it nonetheless, simply because you were expecting bad news today. Next time, try not to worry so much \u2013 life\u2019s events are rarely as bad as you fear."}, {"text": "Forget about reality today and allow your fantasies to guide you. Life does not have to be serious all the time and you are due a few laughs, so do what makes you feel good about yourself and, if possible, help others feel good about themselves too."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t seem much in the mood for fun and games at the moment but there is no need to worry about it. A week or so from now you will be the life and soul of the party again, so get that black mood out of the way now."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign is super busy on your birthday and you will be super busy too. But make sure you are busy on things that matter to you. It\u2019s okay to be a bit selfish, in fact it\u2019s essential. What\u2019s good for you will be good for others too."}, {"text": "You may not be the sort to show your emotional side but you will find it easier than usual today to open up and let loved ones know how you feel, and that\u2019s good because once they know that they will know what they must do to please you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t turn down a social invitation because you have so much work on. This is one of the best times of the year for going out and having fun, so put the serious stuff on hold today and over the weekend. Do only what makes you smile."}, {"text": "The most important thing that is going to happen over the next few days is that you will start thinking a bit more seriously about your financial situation. It may have been easy-come, easy-go in recent weeks but you know that cannot continue forever."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to do anything special today but you do have to realize that, as the sun moves nearer to your birth sign, you need to start making plans. And make them big plans Cancer. If you set your sights high you could soon be soaring."}, {"text": "You may not be your usual happy-go-lucky self over the next few days but that\u2019s okay. Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart makes you fear the worst but once you realize the worst isn\u2019t going to happen you will cheer up again."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks you are set in your ways will be forced to think again as you sweep away the old and usher in the new. Changing times call for a changing outlook and the more you change now the more success you will enjoy later on."}, {"text": "The things you say, the things you do and the way you conduct yourself over the next few days are going to be of even greater importance than usual. Try not to get angry with people who let you down or cannot be trusted. Remaining calm is a must."}, {"text": "It won\u2019t be long before you feel more confident about your place in the wider scheme of things. Today\u2019s Mars-Neptune link can help by opening your mind to new ways of looking at the world, ways based on co-operation rather than conflict."}, {"text": "The planets urge you to be more realistic about your aims and ambitions, especially those that will in some way or other rely on other people. You know from past experience that at some stage someone is sure to let you down, so make allowances for that now."}, {"text": "With Mars in your opposite sign you need to get used to the idea that partners and colleagues are entitled to an equal say in what you do together. If you try to push your own agenda you may find you get nowhere at all. Teamwork is a must."}, {"text": "It\u2019s time to get stuck in to that backlog of jobs that has been building up. Mars in the work area of your chart will give you the energy to get started but to keep yourself motivated you must look ahead to the potential rewards. Don\u2019t give up."}, {"text": "A week from now one of the very best times of the year for you will begin, and between now and then you need to clear away everything that is holding you back from expressing yourself creatively. That may even mean ending a friendship or two."}, {"text": "Money matters and other issues to do with what you own and earn will be of major importance over the coming year. The important thing is that you trust your instincts. If the experts say one thing but your mind says another, then the experts are wrong."}, {"text": "If it is clear that something is no longer working then get rid of it. It\u2019s not like you to be indecisive, so why are you weighing up the pros and cons at every opportunity? You know what needs to be done, so do it and then move on."}, {"text": "Try not to limit yourself to one set of aims and objectives because it is highly likely that your needs will change over the next few weeks. You need to be flexible in your thinking and you need to get past the idea that change is somehow dangerous."}, {"text": "This will either be a successful or a disappointing weekend for you \u2013 there is no middle way. Whichever one it happens to be remind yourself that, in the greater scheme of things, it actually doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it\u2019s what you learn from the experience that counts."}, {"text": "You will clash with someone over the next 48 hours who is as different to you as it is possible to get. There is not much point trying to find common ground between you, because it doesn\u2019t exist, so do what you have to do and live with it."}, {"text": "No matter how ambitious you are and no matter how many wonderful ideas are swirling around in that big brain of yours, keep your feet on the ground. If you get swept along by your own brilliance you could end up being swept away."}, {"text": "Your potential is unlimited Virgo, but you must be selective about the goals and targets you set yourself. Don\u2019t just go after something because you think it sounds good, make sure it is what you really want to be doing. And remember: The future starts today."}, {"text": "\u201cLazy Libra\u201d some people call you \u2013 but they could not be more wrong. The simple fact is you have the priceless ability to recognize what is important in life and what is not, which means you don\u2019t waste your time on trivial things. That\u2019s not lazy, that\u2019s smart."}, {"text": "By all means help someone with what they are stuck on but don\u2019t end up doing it for them. If they flatter you by saying how clever you are that\u2019s a sure sign they are hoping you will take over completely and get it finished. Don\u2019t fall for it!"}, {"text": "You know what you want and where to get it but the approaching full moon warns it won\u2019t be easy. The next few days could be difficult in the sense that you\u2019ll have to fight for what it is you desire \u2013 but that just makes it more worth having."}, {"text": "Someone, somewhere will be offended by your opinions this weekend but that\u2019s a good sign in that it means your words are having an effect. Don\u2019t worry that you might provoke a backlash \u2013 you\u2019ll win in the end because your facts are superior to their feelings."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the work and well-being area of your chart is encouraging you to do more and do better but you need to make sure you don\u2019t do too much. Just because no effort is beyond you does not mean you are obliged to exhaust yourself."}, {"text": "The more promises other people make the less likely it is they will keep them, so be on your guard and don\u2019t get involved with anything that you cannot personally control. And if that means doing nothing, that\u2019s good \u2013 enjoy a completely free weekend."}, {"text": "Jupiter\u2019s influence over the coming year will at times make it seem as if you are living a charmed life, but is that interpretation based on evidence or on wishful thinking? Enjoy your successes, of which there will be many, but be aware of your limitations too."}, {"text": "You will get along better with loved ones when the sun moves into the domestic area of your chart at the weekend. Between now and then try to recognize that whatever differences pull you apart they are not nearly as strong as what keeps you together."}, {"text": "Opportunities to travel have been limited of late but the planets indicate it won\u2019t be long before you are on the move again. But keep it to short journeys for the time being. You will meet all sorts of interesting people in your own neighbourhood."}, {"text": "What you own and what you earn may be uppermost in your mind at the moment but you are advised not to give too much importance to money matters. When Mercury, your ruler, turns retrograde on Thursday you will see why others things matter more."}, {"text": "A few days from now the sun will enter your birth sign and you will get the chance to seize back control of your life in ways that may not have been possible for quite some time. If you can, seize back control for those you love too."}, {"text": "By all means go out of your way to help people in need, but don\u2019t put yourself out to such an extent that you neglect to take care of those you are closest to emotionally. Charity begins at home, so find out what your nearest and dearest desire."}, {"text": "Do you do what is good for you personally, or do you put friends and family members first and put your own needs on the back burner for a while? Only you can decide, but try not to let others take advantage of your generous nature."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of power will be watching you closely over the next few days and it is essential that you make sure they like what they see. Act as if you are being monitored every moment \u2013 but don\u2019t let the pressure get to you!"}, {"text": "You appear to be somewhat restless at the moment, but when Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases on Thursday you may not be able to come and go as you please. Remember, you don\u2019t have to travel physically \u2013 you can travel in the mind as well."}, {"text": "Someone you would not usually look at twice now seems highly desirable, but you are advised to keep it a low key affair as the planets warn it may not last. It could be the start of a beautiful friendship \u2013 or a nightmare you cannot wake up from!"}, {"text": "Over the next week or so there will be a surge of activity in the partnership area of your chart, and if you are in the market for love you could pick up a bargain! But take your time and shop around \u2013 you\u2019ll know when \u201cthe one\u201d appears."}, {"text": "There is no point making too many plans because you won\u2019t be much in the mood for work over the next few days. Even if you do manage to get started on what needs doing it\u2019s unlikely you will finish it, so relax and take things easy, for now."}, {"text": "The more you try to hide your feelings the more obvious they become, so be open and own up to what turns you off and on. And don\u2019t think you have to like everyone. Certain kinds of people will never be your kind of people, so avoid them."}, {"text": "With a full moon on your birthday this year you have to expect some emotional ups and downs, but there will be more of the former than the latter if you try not to see everything in terms of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d. Everything is relative. Nothing is absolute."}, {"text": "Your powers of persuasion will be hard to resist today but you must resist using them for selfish ends. The full moon warns you could lose important friends if you ignore what others need while satisfying your own desires. Everyone can be a winner."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most outgoing area of your chart will bring a lot of joy over the next few days but it could also bring problems that you don\u2019t seem to know when to stop. Not everyone shares your enthusiasms, Taurus. Strange, but true."}, {"text": "You will have to make a big decision today and at least one individual won\u2019t be happy about it. Be that as it may, it has to be done and you are not going to let their tears and tantrums hold you back. It\u2019s about reason, not emotion."}, {"text": "What occurs over the next seven days will answer so many of the questions you have been asking. The only question today though is what are you going to do about someone who refuses to see where they are going wrong? Do nothing. Let them fail."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste any more time and energy on someone you don\u2019t get along with. The simple fact is you are on two completely different paths and there is no sign of those paths converging in the near future. You don\u2019t need them and they don\u2019t need you."}, {"text": "Over the coming week you will get a clearer idea of what needs to be done to improve your career situation and your place in the world in general. Today though you need to help a friend or loved one get over a loss of some kind. Be sympathetic."}, {"text": "Try to be patient with someone who seems determined to believe that the worst is going to happen when, in fact, all the evidence points in the opposite direction. If you can, reason with them. If you can\u2019t, let them know you find them amusing."}, {"text": "An issue that has been nagging at you for weeks, maybe months, can now be brought into the open and dealt with. If it involves other people\u2019s money then make sure those people are consulted every step of the way. You need them on your side."}, {"text": "A full moon in your sign means that something in your life must be brought to an end. It may have been fun once upon a time, but now it is holding you back from doing more interesting things. Be ruthless. Don\u2019t let your emotions get in the way."}, {"text": "The most important thing today is that you make sure others don\u2019t get the idea that you are using them for your own ends. If there is something they can do to help you then be open about it \u2013 and ask them what you can do in return."}, {"text": "Listen carefully to what your heart tells you today and if what you hear clashes with what your friends are saying then clearly your friends have got it wrong. There is too much wishful thinking in the air at the moment. Don\u2019t be fooled."}, {"text": "Even if you find it difficult to be honest with other people today you must be honest with yourself. It is now crystal clear that a work-related project is not progressing as expected and needs a major rethink. Can it be saved? That\u2019s up to you."}, {"text": "Material issues such as making money and enjoying the good things in life will take centre stage over the coming year, but you must still make time for love and laughter. If you don\u2019t have those, no amount of material things will make up for it."}, {"text": "Disagreements of one kind or another are likely, with family members especially, but one thing you should be able to agree on is that each of you has the right to go your own way and do your own thing. Give others some space, and demand your own, too."}, {"text": "An offer of some kind won\u2019t be on the table for long, so you need to decide quickly if it is right for you and, if it is, accept it without further delay. Trust what your friends tell you about it, but trust your own instincts more."}, {"text": "Anyone who mistakes your agreeable nature for weakness is making a serious error. You know what you want and what you are capable of and just because you smile and try to be nice to people does not mean you can be dissuaded or defeated."}, {"text": "If a rival tells you that what you are doing is wrong you can take it as read that it is in fact right. Since when do they care if you make a mistake? Since never, so carry on doing what you are doing and make a success of it."}, {"text": "You would be wise to keep your plans secret today, because if certain people get to hear about them they could try to stop you from reaching your goal. The time to boast about what you are doing is when you have actually done it, not before."}, {"text": "If someone offers you something you have wanted for quite a while there is no need to be suspicious. Cosmic activity in the friendship area of your chart means they genuinely want you to have it. Your happiness will make them happy too."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will bring a work-related offer your way, but can you be sure it\u2019s the right thing for you? Yes you can, and if you accept it then it won\u2019t be long before you are climbing the ladder of success."}, {"text": "You know exactly what it is you want and the more others say you are aiming too high or expecting too much of yourself the more determined you will be to get it. Once you have a goal there is no doubt at all you will reach it."}, {"text": "You may have to deal with something less than enjoyable today but it is your job to take charge and you are not the sort to shirk your responsibilities. The good news is it won\u2019t be as traumatic as you feared \u2013 who knows, it may even be fun."}, {"text": "If there is something you need to say that might upset friends or loved ones then say it now and get it over with. You may not want to hurt their feelings but sooner or later you are going to have to be honest with them. Make it sooner."}, {"text": "Despite what you may think no one is out to get you and no one wants to see you fail. Today\u2019s Mars-Mercury link could make you a bit too suspicious, especially on the work front where others\u2019 remarks, if you listen to them, could actually be quite helpful."}, {"text": "Just because you seem to be able to get away with anything at the moment does not mean you have a right to ignore the rules. The planets warn if you take too many liberties over the next few days the criticism you attract could be extreme."}, {"text": "You may find yourself taking the opposite viewpoint to people in positions of power this year, but that\u2019s good. You are under no obligation to agree with them on everything and they will respect you more if you fight for what you believe to be right."}, {"text": "If someone tries to hurry you into making a quick decision today or tomorrow you must resist. Despite what they may be telling you there is no clock ticking, so take it slow, a step at a time, and make sure you get it right."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to reason with someone who is giving you a hard time. Instead, remove yourself from their presence and let them sort the situation out for themselves. They will make such a poor job of it they will beg you to return."}, {"text": "The best way to deal with an unpleasant situation is to pretend it does not exist. That may sound like the easy way out, and it is, but why should you make life difficult for yourself when it is not you who is being difficult? Blank it out."}, {"text": "You may have strong opinions about something, but you must make sure they are backed up by the facts or not only will you look silly but you could lose out professionally and financially as well. Don\u2019t forget who signs your paycheque!"}, {"text": "There is no point making promises if you won\u2019t be able to deliver on them. The planets warn there is a danger today that you might get carried away by your own enthusiasm, which sounds like fun but could also be costly on several levels."}, {"text": "If a friend asks you to get involved with a cause or movement by all means consider it but make sure it\u2019s a good fit for you. Don\u2019t sign up just because you feel guilty that you may not be doing enough. You\u2019re already doing more than most."}, {"text": "If you find yourself in the right place at the right time to take advantage of some kind of opportunity today, and you will, you must not hesitate. If you take too long one of your rivals may nip in ahead of you and steal the glory."}, {"text": "Friends and family members will give you all the support you need today, but only if they know where and when and how you require their assistance. They cannot read your mind, Scorpio, which considering what goes on in there may be just as well!"}, {"text": "If you make some kind of mistake today don\u2019t stop to worry about it, just push on and make the best of the situation. You may well find that, as errors go, it is really of only minor importance. You may even be the only one who notices."}, {"text": "You must be rational in your thinking and reasonable in your actions. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign warns that if you stray from the straight and narrow by even an inch your rivals will make life difficult for you \u2013 and it\u2019s already difficult enough."}, {"text": "By all means speak your mind today, but make sure what you say is truthful. Not that you plan to lie, of course, but there may be a temptation to stretch the truth a little, and that could lead to all sorts of problems further down the line."}, {"text": "It\u2019s time to show people that you have ideas of your own and that you are more than happy to back up those ideas with action. Express yourself creatively in whatever area of life it is that inspires you the most. Your self-belief will inspire others too."}, {"text": "Anyone who doubts you are willing to fight for what you desire will be proved wrong this year. There will be no negotiation with rivals who try to take what should be yours, and no mercy for anyone who might be stupid enough to try to oppose you."}, {"text": "This is an important time for family matters and because of that you must stay positive. Give partners and loved ones room to do their own thing in their own way and don\u2019t take it as a personal slight if they choose not to do it your way."}, {"text": "The sun is about to move in your favour and it won\u2019t be long before you are the life and soul of the party again. Forget about moving ahead at work or making more money, get out into the world and have fun with your friends."}, {"text": "You seem to be in one of your aggressive moods at the moment and with Mars, planet of anger, at odds with Pluto, planet of power, you must be careful who you attack or upset. Err on the side of caution: Don\u2019t attack or upset anyone."}, {"text": "The sun moves into your sign tomorrow and over the following weeks the conditions will be ripe to make the most of the many talents you were born with, not least your natural creativity. Make something that wows the world \u2013 and makes you millions!"}, {"text": "You will feel compelled to get involved in a friend\u2019s personal issues today, and although you will do so purely out of the goodness of your heart it\u2019s unlikely you will get any thanks for it. Don\u2019t let that stop you though \u2013 they need your assistance."}, {"text": "You have the happy knack of being able to get along with all sorts of people and that ability will serve you well over the next few days. Don\u2019t be too nice though. Some people will need reminding that what they recently did was wrong."}, {"text": "The ambitious side of your nature will come to the fore over the next few days, so if you need to impress important people with your drive and determination now is the time. Make an effort to do something really special, something that enhances your reputation."}, {"text": "This could be a disruptive sort of day and there is no way of knowing for sure whether you will gain or lose from what happens. However, as the sun is about to move in your favour even apparent setbacks will throw up new opportunities. Be ready."}, {"text": "If someone tries to force you to do something against your will over the next few days you will complain long and loud about it, and quite right too. The more noise you make the more likely it is they will be embarrassed and get off your back."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t change your ways easily but what happens today and tomorrow could see you reassessing what you believe and maybe, just maybe, making some major alterations. Listen to what loved ones tell you \u2013 it will give you a better perspective."}, {"text": "Be brave and tell loved ones what they need to hear rather than what they want to hear. They are unlikely to thank you for it in the short term but later on, when events prove you right, they will be gracious enough to admit they were wrong."}, {"text": "By all means work hard but don\u2019t strain your body or your mind. As the sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart tomorrow you should be saving your energy for the great opportunities to come, so don\u2019t peak too early and risk hurting yourself."}, {"text": "Neptune, planet of imagination, begins one of its retrograde phases on your birthday, which among other things means you must give more weight to what your rational mind tells you. Remember, just because you can imagine something does not make it true."}, {"text": "You should know by now that you create your own luck in life, and if you resolve to think in a positive manner and act in honourable ways then fortune will smile on you. It will also smile on those you love. Luck has a way of expanding."}, {"text": "The pace of life will pick up over the next few days and there are sure to be times when you lose track of where you are and what you are doing. It won\u2019t be a problem though so long as you remember where you want to end up."}, {"text": "A friend or work colleague will offer their assistance today and if you are smart you will accept, even though you suspect there may be strings attached. Anything worth having in life is worth paying for, but don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be too much."}, {"text": "You have so much to look forward to now the sun is moving into your sign, so why the glum face? Whatever it is that is bringing about this black mood you need to get over it quickly. Fortune favours the brave \u2013 and the happy!"}, {"text": "What you thought was a problem yesterday will resolve itself to your satisfaction today. In fact, looked at from a wider perspective, you may recognize that it was never really a problem at all. Stop searching so hard and let life work its magic for you."}, {"text": "If you find yourself at odds with someone you admire over the next few days try talking things through with them. Almost certainly you can learn from each other and almost certainly the distance between you is not as wide as it might appear."}, {"text": "You may be at the mercy of events but you don\u2019t have to sit there and let things happen. On the contrary, it is essential that you get out into the world and do what you can to make it a better place. You CAN make a difference."}, {"text": "This is one of the best times of the year for you and if you want something enough you will find ways to get it. The sun in Cancer over the next few weeks will bring so much adventure. Be on the move both in mind and in body."}, {"text": "Why so timid? Why so afraid? It\u2019s not like you to hide away from the world and hope it doesn\u2019t notice, so what\u2019s got into you? The sun\u2019s change of signs today will certainly bring challenges, but they are challenges to be welcomed, not feared."}, {"text": "You would be wise to let someone you trust know your innermost thoughts over the next 24 hours. The fact is you are still in two minds about what your next move should be and only an outsider\u2019s input can give you the perspective you need."}, {"text": "You may not be happy with some of the tasks you\u2019ve been asked to do but don\u2019t despair. Once you get into them you will discover that this kind of work can actually be fun \u2013 and working with your hands stops you thinking too much."}, {"text": "Now that the sun is moving into the most creative area of your chart you must be more dynamic. Focus on what means most to you personally and don\u2019t let others\u2019 doubts and fears hold you back. You can and you will get it right this time."}, {"text": "You must not allow other people\u2019s emotional issues to take up too large a slice of your time and energy. Fate has marked you out as someone who can change the world, but the world is unlikely to notice if you are caught up in petty domestic squabbles."}, {"text": "If there is a chore you have to do then get on with it immediately. The longer you leave it the harder it will be to get started and the tougher it will be when you finally get round to it. Even an Aries has to do boring stuff sometimes."}, {"text": "Stop worrying about a personal matter. Put it out of your mind once and for all. There are far too many interesting things going on in your world at the moment to waste time on trivia such as this \u2013 and, yes, it is trivial, and you know it."}, {"text": "According to the planets if you can be a bit more adaptable and a bit more open to new ideas you will reach a target of some sort with ease. Also, once you have reached that target you should immediately set yourself two more. Geminis love to multitask."}, {"text": "Like it or not you are going to be the centre of attention over the next few weeks, so come out of the shadows and stand confidently in the light. The sun in your sign indicates success at every turn, so what is there to be afraid of? Nothing."}, {"text": "If someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time today you will want to hit back at them in some way. But don\u2019t let the situation get out of hand. The fact is they can do things to you that you cannot do to them."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your hopes and wishes urges you to put a name to your dream and then go all out to make it a reality. You won\u2019t be able to do it on your own, though. Get a team you can trust behind you."}, {"text": "There is no reason why you should be afraid to take on more responsibility. Whatever it is you are now being asked to do you have what it takes to make a huge success of it. Step into the spotlight and let the world see what star quality looks like."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t stick up for your values then who will? With the sun, Mars and Mercury all moving through the area of your chart that gives meaning to your world, you can and you must fight for your beliefs, no matter how controversial they may be."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t bother asking friends and family members what they want to do this weekend because almost certainly they won\u2019t know. Be decisive and choose the activities you are going to be doing together. They will happily go along with your plans."}, {"text": "If you have been too cautious in recent weeks then you may now be tempted to go to the other extreme and take risks that leave you exposed. Is that really a good idea? Capricorns are supposed to be smart, so maybe think again."}, {"text": "Steer clear of other people\u2019s fights and feuds. There is nothing you can do to end them \u2013 in fact you could end up making matters worse \u2013 so let them get on with it and devote your own energies to matters where your input might actually help."}, {"text": "Decide what it is you most want to do and then do it with all your heart and soul. The sun and Mars in your fellow water sign of Cancer indicate that almost anything you choose to focus on now will go well in ways you cannot yet imagine."}, {"text": "As Neptune turns retrograde on your birthday this year you need to be wary of getting too idealistic in the way you look at the world. Yes, of course, you should always be positive, but try not to get seduced by ideas that ignore life\u2019s harsher realities."}, {"text": "One of your little secrets may become public knowledge today, and if it does you must not act in the least bit embarrassed. Brazen it out and pretend you enjoy being the center of attention. If you go on the defensive the mob will go on a feeding frenzy."}, {"text": "Your powers of persuasion are strong right now, so decide what it is you need to convince others about and then let the words flow. But make sure you use your word skills for positive ends. Add to the sum of human knowledge, don\u2019t subtract from it."}, {"text": "Your schedule is more demanding than it needs to be, so find ways to cut back on what you are doing. Remember, too, that while it\u2019s nice to be able to help other people, you should not do so to the detriment of your own needs and aims."}, {"text": "You are beginning to believe \u2013 not just on a mental level, but deep inside your gut \u2013 that all things are possible. Create a vision of the kind of life you want to enjoy and hold it in your mind over the next few hours. Visions often become realities."}, {"text": "A joint endeavour may not have developed as smoothly or as quickly as you had hoped but stick at it. The planets indicate if you hang in there just a little longer it will all come together in a matter of days, if not hours. It\u2019s all about timing."}, {"text": "Steer clear of certain individuals today, not because you don\u2019t like them but because if they engage you in small talk you may not be able to get away for several hours. Yes, it can be nice to chat, but you have important things to take care of."}, {"text": "It may be tempting to redouble your efforts and smash your way through your workload, but be careful. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart warns you may not be as physically robust as you think you are. Most work can wait."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t get angry, with other people or with yourself, if you can\u2019t make much sense of what\u2019s going on. As Neptune begins its retrograde phase it may seem as if reality itself has decided to take a break, but it hasn\u2019t. You\u2019re just confused."}, {"text": "You need to rise above petty disputes, especially on the home front, and recognize that partners and loved ones have a point of view that is valid too. You may honestly believe that you are right and they are wrong, but your differences are mainly illusions."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t find it hard to get other people to listen to you today, but is what you have to say what they need to know? The planets warn if your own thoughts are confused you will confuse other people too. Maybe just stay silent for now."}, {"text": "The world may be full of things you want to possess but don\u2019t waste your money on toys and trinkets that will lose their appeal in a matter of days. If you must splash the cash today try buying things \u2013 like books \u2013 that broaden your mind."}, {"text": "Whatever problems you are called on to solve today you need to understand there may be no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answers. Everything depends on the perspective you choose to take, so focus on what is positive and uplifting, then life won\u2019t be a problem at all."}, {"text": "Your devotion to someone is admirable but there will be times over the coming months when you wonder if it is well placed. You only have so much time and energy \u2013 and love \u2013 to go around, so be generous in your affections, but be sensible too."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of affection, is strong in your chart, so you won\u2019t lack for admirers, but other aspects suggest that too much fun could lead to trouble, especially if you get flirty with someone. It may mean nothing to you but not everyone will see it that way."}, {"text": "Put your money worries behind you and do something that makes you feel good about yourself. If you feel the need to get away from your everyday environment don\u2019t ask for permission, just get up and go. Who in their right mind would try to stop you?"}, {"text": "Promise yourself here and now that no matter what happens over the next few days you won\u2019t take it seriously and you won\u2019t take it personally. Setbacks may cause a bit of anxiety but in the greater scheme of things they are of minor importance."}, {"text": "The next few days should be thoroughly enjoyable, although you may look back a few weeks hence and wish you had kept some of your more controversial thoughts to yourself. Be that as it may, your outlook is sunny in the extreme. Enjoy."}, {"text": "Being such a generous sort you won\u2019t hesitate to help someone in need today, but you must make sure that their tale of woe is genuine and not something they made up just to get at your cash. Give them your sympathy but not your money."}, {"text": "Someone you meet in the course of your work or business activities will set your heart racing today, and you could certainly do with some excitement. But don\u2019t get too attached because this is a relationship that could end as suddenly as it begins."}, {"text": "You enjoy doing what others say cannot be done but don\u2019t get carried away, because with Venus, your ruler, under quite a bit of pressure at the moment you could easily take on more than you can handle. Be kind to yourself \u2013 set targets you can reach."}, {"text": "Do something different today, something that surprises those around you. According to the planets you have become a bit too predictable of late and need to shake things up. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big but it does have to be unexpected."}, {"text": "It\u2019s always a mistake to put money before love and if you have to choose between the two over the next 24 hours you must let the romantic part of your nature guide you. You can be poor financially and survive but what use is life without passion?"}, {"text": "You have so much to look forward to over the coming weeks and months, so banish your blues and focus on the things that give you most joy. The planets indicate that if you think and feel lucky you will be lucky, so why wallow in despair?"}, {"text": "You may be rational by nature but logic isn\u2019t everything and over the next few days you should listen as much to your heart as you do to your head. What appears to be an irrational course of action could turn out to be the making of you."}, {"text": "The sun in your fellow water sign of Cancer indicates good times aplenty but other influences warn that a domestic situation is getting away from you and needs to be resolved today. Tell loved ones what they need to hear, even if they don\u2019t enjoy it."}, {"text": "A partnership or relationship could be in a for a bumpy ride over the coming 12 months but it won\u2019t be so bad if you resolve here and now not to get flustered or upset. Keep your emotions in check and don\u2019t let your smile slip for even a second."}, {"text": "There are so many changes going on in your world at the moment that you may be feeling a bit apprehensive. The good news is that over the next seven days the planets will start moving in your favour again, so don\u2019t waste time worrying for no good reason."}, {"text": "Think big and make sure that those you have dealings with, both at work and in your private life, recognize that you are not going to accept second best. Anyone who tries to pour cold water on your ambitions is not a friend and must be shown the door."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t take anything for granted today and don\u2019t take chances with money. It may be that people you have financial dealings with have every intention of being honest with you but events could tempt them to cut corners at your expense. Don\u2019t let it happen."}, {"text": "You want things done your way now and if anyone disagrees they may wish they had kept their thoughts to themselves. You are in no mood for compromise, and why should you be when it\u2019s clear you are one of the few who know what\u2019s going on?"}, {"text": "Throw the rule book out of window and do it your way. Changing things step by step clearly has not worked for you so go to the other extreme and be radical both in word and in deed. With your enviable self-belief you\u2019ll no doubt get away with it."}, {"text": "Because your current doings are, to say the least, a bit controversial you may find that friends and family members are reluctant to back you up. Don\u2019t try to force them, but don\u2019t change what you are doing either. You\u2019ll still find success through sheer force of will."}, {"text": "There are opposing forces in your life that need to be reconciled but you won\u2019t do it by trying to please everyone. Decide what you think is fair and let everyone know that if they don\u2019t do what you say you\u2019ll be on your way \u2013 and mean it!"}, {"text": "Something will happen that has a profound effect on your outlook, which in turn will cause you to rethink your ambitions. Are you being true to the image you have of yourself as a serious mover and shaker? If not, you can and you must start to change."}, {"text": "If you want something good to come into your life then you need to get rid of something else that is taking up too much space. It may not be in your nature to be ruthless but on this occasion you have no choice but to cut ties and move on."}, {"text": "You will break any rule you do not agree with today and you won\u2019t care in the slightest what people say about it. You are in one of those moods when the more opposition you encounter, the more determined you are to come out on top."}, {"text": "Try not to say or do anything that might turn important people against you. You must be true to your beliefs, of course, but if you are smart you will present them in a less confrontational way. Life is not a war, so don\u2019t make every day a battle."}, {"text": "Think before you act and act only if you are sure it\u2019s the right thing to do. The planets warn if you make a wrong move it could be quite a while before you get back on track, and that would be both a shame and a waste."}, {"text": "You can sometimes be a bit too inhibited for your own good, but over the coming year you will throw off all restraint and make a big noise about who you are and what you intend to do with your life. Don\u2019t just talk it, Cancer \u2013 walk it too!"}, {"text": "Your ideas may seem outrageous and unworkable to some, but they make perfect sense to you and you intend to put them into effect. Uranus, planet of genius, urges you to accept that no idea should be considered taboo: if you believe in it you can make it work."}, {"text": "You will make a big impression on a number of important people today, but will it be the right kind of impression? If you say too much or come on too strong you may find they prefer to keep you at arm\u2019s length \u2013 they feel safer that way."}, {"text": "Ignore what other people say you should be doing and do what you know in your heart to be right. Even if it costs you financially or loses you friends you know if you cannot be true to your beliefs you can never be happy in yourself."}, {"text": "The sun in your sign links to Uranus over the next few days, which suggests that whatever you do and however you choose to do it the results will be spectacular. Do something out of the ordinary and earn the respect and admiration you crave."}, {"text": "People expect you to act quickly and decisively and you won\u2019t let them down over the next few days. But don\u2019t act merely to impress your adoring fans. Your actions must have a reason and there must be a clearly defined goal that you are aiming to reach."}, {"text": "There may be some tension in the air today but you must ignore it and focus on the task that is right in front of you. The changes that are about to take place cannot be prevented, so wait and see what happens and adapt as best you can."}, {"text": "With the sun and changes planet Uranus forming an encouraging link today you are sure to be one of those who benefits from the upheavals that are taking place around you. Ultimately, all change is good change, so go with the flow and have fun."}, {"text": "Some people bring out the best in you and some people bring out the worst, but you need to understand that it\u2019s not what they do that matters but how you choose to react to it. The best kind of reaction today is probably no reaction at all."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be in the mood to play it safe today, not when you can sense that the more you push yourself the more you will accomplish. Also, you will come up with a great idea that is not only stunningly simple but potentially a money-maker too."}, {"text": "Decide what needs to be done and ignore the naysayers and the doom-mongers who claim you are moving too fast or taking too many risks. Maybe you are, but if you hold back over the next 24 hours you will look back one day and regret it."}, {"text": "You will make a major breakthrough over the next few days, the kind of breakthrough that only an Aquarius has the kind of mind to imagine and the level of self-belief to make it happen. Not everyone will agree you\u2019re a genius . . . but you are."}, {"text": "Whatever plans you are in the middle of making you won\u2019t be able to keep them a secret for long \u2013 you are just too full of yourself to be discreet. So go to the other extreme and shout long and loud about what you are up to!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t stick with tried and trusted ways of doing things this year. The more you look for alternatives the more likely it is you will find that a brand new path opens up for you, one that is both easy to travel and lined with awesome possibilities."}, {"text": "Anyone who gives you a hard time over the next few days is going to regret it. As Mercury, planet of communication, moves into your fellow fire sign of Leo you won\u2019t hesitate to tell others what you think of them \u2013 and it may not be nice!"}, {"text": "Be careful what you say over the next day or two because you could easily say too much and upset a friend or family member whose support you are going to need. You may seem placid by nature but your tongue can be quite sharp at times!"}, {"text": "Venus in your sign makes it easy for you to get along with all sorts of people, and with Mercury strong in your chart too you will have plenty to say to those you meet along the way. Don\u2019t say too much, though. Some things should stay private."}, {"text": "You must make sure that what you ask for is what you really want because the planets warn that once you have got it you may not be able to give it back. Also, you need to recognize that your thoughts have value, both financially and emotionally."}, {"text": "You have rarely been so energetic and so enthusiastic for life. For best results though you must rein in your excitement and focus on just one or two aims. This is potentially a really good time for you but you must be disciplined."}, {"text": "Avoid petty arguments with petty people over petty matters. That, in a nutshell, is the message of the stars for Virgo today, so raise your sights and refuse to get involved in anything that is beneath your dignity, both in your private life and in your work."}, {"text": "You will find your voice today and won\u2019t be shy about telling the world what you think about . . . well, just about everything. However, just because you have an opinion does not mean your opinion is right. Have you checked the facts on which it is based?"}, {"text": "Moderation is essential, especially if you are the sort of Scorpio who thinks the best way to get on in the world is to take on rivals who are bigger than you and beat them every which way. You may be right, but today it could be you who loses."}, {"text": "You will be incredibly decisive over the next 24 hours and those who don\u2019t share your drive and determination will soon be left behind. Just remember that not even a Sagittarius can be on top of their game to this extent indefinitely. Relax once in a while."}, {"text": "You have no choice now but to face up to obligations you have been avoiding. They may be personal, or they may be professional, but either way you can and you must deal with them. People will look kindly on you if you show willing."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s link between the sun and your ruling planet Uranus will protect you if you decide to take a risk of some sort, but you will be even safer if you team up with a friend. Their eyes could spot a potential trouble spot that you may have missed."}, {"text": "If someone makes unreasonable demands of you today tell them to take a running jump. You are under no obligation to do as they say and you certainly should not do so if it puts you at risk. You\u2019re your own boss Pisces, so do as you please."}, {"text": "The more self-assured you are the more others will respect you, and the more they respect you the more likely it is they will help you realize your dream. Be confident, be courageous, but be modest, too. You don\u2019t have to show off to be a star."}, {"text": "Differences of opinion on the home front are to be expected now the sun is moving through the domestic area of your chart, but they don\u2019t have to be painful. You actually disagree on very few things, so why let them spoil your most important relationships?"}, {"text": "If someone tells you to do one thing today you will do the opposite just for the fun of it, but remember that it works both ways. Even if others know you are right about something they will delight in disagreeing just to annoy you. It\u2019s all good fun."}, {"text": "The sun is now moving through the area of your chart that governs what you own, what you earn and material things in general. So if your money situation is not as strong as you would like it to be now is the time to do something about it."}, {"text": "With the sun moving through your sign and a Cancer solar eclipse on the horizon something big is clearly on its way. What that something is remains to be seen but it will change your life in fundamental ways. Don\u2019t worry, they will be good ways."}, {"text": "This is the time of year when you are at your most thoughtful and one of the things you should be thinking about is whether you are living your dream. What is it that truly inspires you? Are you doing it? If not, get started!"}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks you are too cautious and too stuck in your ways will be impressed by how quickly you move with the times over the next few weeks. You don\u2019t change often but when you do you do it properly and go all the way."}, {"text": "This is an important time for you as career matters are highlighted by the sun and Mars in the vocational area of your chart. Mars will soon be moving on though, so if you want to make your mark on the work front Libra now is the time."}, {"text": "Your outlook will improve considerably over the next few days and what happens around the time of next Tuesday\u2019s eclipse will bring the kind of opportunities you have hardly dared dream about in recent months.

Emotions can be dangerous."}, {"text": "You need to get your act together, Capricorn, and the best way to do that is to get assistance from people who have already finished what you have only just begun. Ask friends and family members for advice \u2013 chances are you\u2019ll get more than you expected. "}, {"text": "You have strong opinions on just about every subject under the sun but just because you have those opinions does not mean you are obliged to express them. The planets warn if you are too outspoken today your money situation could take a hit."}, {"text": "The sun in the sympathetic sign of Cancer makes this one of the best times of the year for you, but to make the most of it you must be more daring. Good things will happen, for sure, but they will happen quicker if you seize the initiative."}, {"text": "Your main problem Cancer is that you don\u2019t always believe in yourself, which means you sometimes miss out because you are hesitant to act. This year you can and you must be more confident of your abilities. Don\u2019t aim to be good, aim to be the best."}, {"text": "As an Aries you hate to admit that you make mistakes like everyone else \u2013 it puts a dent in your ego \u2013 but you do and, if someone points out where you have made an error this weekend you must thank them for it. But don\u2019t make any more."}, {"text": "Stop worrying what other people might think of you and start doing the things you know will make you happy. If you keep telling yourself that you are the best you will start to believe it, and when you believe it then it will become a reality."}, {"text": "Try not to take any silly chances over the next 48 hours and especially don\u2019t do or say anything that could damage your reputation. That might sound a bit restrictive for your liking, but later on you will understand why it was necessary to tread carefully."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t push yourself too hard or expect too much of yourself. The sun in your sign gives you a great deal of confidence and energy but other influences warn if you take a step in the wrong direction you may then have to take several steps back."}, {"text": "You always look on the bright side, and that\u2019s good, but it will pay you to be aware of some of the potential pitfalls which lay ahead of you.

Remember, until you try you never know what you can do."}, {"text": "You are well aware of the fact that what people say and what people mean can be two entirely different things, so be wary of anyone who makes grand promises this weekend. Almost certainly they are setting themselves up for failure. Don\u2019t be part of it."}, {"text": "You need to deal with someone who has taken a liberty too many this weekend. Let them know you find their actions disrespectful and that you won\u2019t stand for it any longer. You\u2019ve been a nice guy too often Sag \u2013 now it\u2019s time to get tough."}, {"text": "Because the sun is moving through your opposite sign at the moment there will be one and maybe several occasions over the next 48 hours when you are no longer in control of events.

Stay calm and you will adapt with ease."}, {"text": "You may not lack for energy, and you certainly don\u2019t lack for ambition, but just because you have those things does not mean you have to use them.

Good. Get a new image."}, {"text": "You will be quite persuasive over the coming year and your words will sound both moderate and meaningful to most people.

Be a warrior for truth and justice."}, {"text": "You will impress employers and other important people more over the next 24 hours if you ignore outside distractions and get on with what you are supposed to be doing.

You must, however, avoid the kind of tactics that might alienate those who, like you, prize their liberty,"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the relationship area of your chart means you need to pay more attention to partners and loved ones.

A few days from now you will be busier than ever both at home and at work, so pace yourself carefully."}, {"text": "When you get a passion for something you go all the way, and with your ruling planet Pluto linked strongly with Jupiter today there is a real possibility you will go to extremes. Try to take a more moderate approach \u2013 and avoid politics and religion!"}, {"text": "By all means forgive someone who has let you down in some way, but don\u2019t forget about it.

It\u2019s top speed all the way Aries!"}, {"text": "If someone targets you for criticism over the next few days it\u2019s only because they are jealous of your popularity and success.

Yes, of course, you must take your responsibilities seriously but not so seriously that you cannot enjoy yourself."}, {"text": "As Mars moves into the money area of your chart today you will become increasingly determined to earn what you think you deserve \u2013 which is much more than you are getting right now. Demand top dollar in all situations, and you will get it."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign over the next month or so guarantees that whatever challenges you face you can and you will overcome them. You have always had a high opinion of your own abilities \u2013 now that opinion will go through the roof and into the stratosphere!"}, {"text": "The planets warn this is not a good time to take risks when dealing with people who possess more power and influence than you.

Start looking for people and places that offer you more of a challenge."}, {"text": "You may be under the impression that you can get away with anything, and maybe you can, but the planets warn if you slip up and make a mistake it could cost you big time. You know how much you hate to lose money, so don\u2019t be reckless."}, {"text": "The question you most need to ask yourself today is: \u201cCan I rely on other people to help me get what I desire?\u201d As Mars moves into your opposite sign you must make sure that partners and colleagues share your ambitions.

You will bring as much passion to your social life today as you do to more serious activities such as your work."}, {"text": "You could be worth a lot more financially by the end of the day, but you could just as easily be worth a lot less, depending on how you choose to invest your money. Take a risk if you must but make sure you know what is at stake."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s solar eclipse in your sign is a magnificent omen of success and if you use the next few hours to clarify in your mind what it is you are after there is no doubt you will get it. Think big, aim high and enjoy life to the full."}, {"text": "If you are smart you will spend at least some of the day in quiet contemplation of what you have accomplished in life and what you still want to do. Put a name to your dream and then promise yourself that you won\u2019t rest until you reach it."}, {"text": "The more time you spend with people who seem to be on the same wavelength as you the more likely it is you will do something together that could not have been done on your own. Many big brains are better than just one big brain."}, {"text": "A solar eclipse in the career area of your chart urges you to aim higher than you have ever aimed before. There really is nothing you cannot accomplish now if you put your mind to it, so get busy and make your mark on the world."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s eclipse will give you a much clearer idea of what is and is not possible and the good news is that even major restrictions won\u2019t be able to hold you back. Stop worrying about what tomorrow might bring and start living more fully today."}, {"text": "Try not to attach so much importance to material things. Yes, of course, money and possessions have their place in this life like everything else but they must not have pride of place. That belongs to the one thing money can\u2019t buy \u2013 true love."}, {"text": "Partnerships and relationships are under excellent stars today and if you make an effort to let loved ones know how much you care for them it could be one of the most joyous days of the year. Don\u2019t hold back \u2013 let your emotions guide you."}, {"text": "Decide what you want to be doing more of over the next six months, then draw up a plan and get on with it.

Every moment and every decision counts."}, {"text": "Creatively and romantically anything and everything is possible for you now \u2013 yes, it really is that good. Today\u2019s solar eclipse will inspire you to move faster and fly higher than you have ever done before. The only way is up . . . and up . . . and up."}, {"text": "Use your considerable charm to get what you need over the coming 12 months.

Your way with words will win everyone round to your point of view."}, {"text": "As Venus, planet of harmony, joins the sun in the domestic sector of your chart today you will find that family issues are so much easier to deal with. Any minor disputes you may have been having can and must be resolved over the next few days."}, {"text": "You will be on the move in some way or other before the end of the week, so be prepared to get up and go the moment the call to action arrives. It need not be a traumatic experience. Focus on your destination but enjoy the journey too."}, {"text": "What you own and what you earn may be uppermost in your mind but don\u2019t let it detract from your social activities. And don\u2019t for a moment believe that to get the most enjoyment from life you have to pay out big bucks. Real fun is for free."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of love and harmony, moves into your sign today, bringing with it an air of relaxation and the feeling that all is good with the world. That may not be true for everyone, of course, but it is certainly true for you."}, {"text": "You will help someone in need today without being asked and your generosity will pay off in a big way later on when it is you who requires assistance. Anyone who thinks you care only for money and success knows nothing about who you really are."}, {"text": "Do you listen to your heart or do you listen to your friends? As they are saying much the same thing it should not be a difficult decision. If you take the best bits from both then everyone will be happy, but none more so than you."}, {"text": "An authority figure will look kindly on you today and if you do what you can to repay their faith in you it could be the start of a profitable relationship. Your ability to get on with all sorts of people will benefit you in unexpected ways."}, {"text": "Because you seem so restless of late it may appear to some people that you are trying to avoid them, but it isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s just that you need to make sure you have the freedom to come and go as you please, and that means no emotional baggage."}, {"text": "Someone you would not usually be attracted to is on your mind constantly of late. Why is that? Most likely it\u2019s because you can sense that, under the skin, the two of you are actually very much alike. You could in fact make a very good team."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the relationship area of your chart today, so if you are looking for love there is every chance you will find it. And if you\u2019re not looking for it? Then an existing commitment will grow deeper and stronger."}, {"text": "You may not be much in the mood for work today but that\u2019s okay. Cosmic activity in the well-being area of your chart encourages you to take a more laid-back approach to life, at least for the time being. Why exhaust yourself when you don\u2019t have to?"}, {"text": "There is no point trying to hide your feelings because they can quite easily be read in your face. Pisces is an emotional sign and you desperately need an outlet for the sentiments that are now surging through you. Be they good or bad, you cannot deny them."}, {"text": "A moon-Mars link on your birthday warns you must not allow yourself to be emotional or sentimental about material things. If you ignore what your head tries to tell you when making financial decisions it will almost certainly cost you money."}, {"text": "You must stick with a project or program of some kind a while longer, because the planets suggest that a breakthrough is imminent. What you are doing may not come naturally to you but at some point you will \u201cget it\u201d and then it will be fun."}, {"text": "Avoid getting involved in disputes and disagreements that have nothing to do with you. It may annoy a friend or relative that you refuse to take their side but the only side that matters is your own side, so do what is right for you alone."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to place your trust in a stranger today but is that really such a good idea? The planets warn that although they may seem friendly it could just be an act designed to lull you into a false sense of security."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be surprised if something you feel strongly about fails to excite those around you. Just because it inspires you does not mean others will be inspired in the same way. Maybe they are right, maybe you are taking it too seriously."}, {"text": "If someone annoys you today they are sure to regret it. The moon\u2019s eclipse of Mars puts you on an emotional knife edge and the slightest thing could set you off. Later on you will look back and wonder how on earth you got so worked up so quickly!"}, {"text": "Try not to get uptight if someone whose support you can usually rely on opposes you today. What you need to remember is that they have their own opinions and their own personal reasons for wanting to move in a different direction. You can still be friends."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to focus in one direction for any length of time today as there are so many things going on around you. But that\u2019s okay as the more you do the more you will enjoy life. One thing is for sure: you won\u2019t be bored!"}, {"text": "Something will happen on the work front today that could provoke you to drop that calm Scorpio manner and give as good as you get \u2013 and then some more! If you do lose control, everyone will be shaking afterwards, none more so than you."}, {"text": "You seem to be reading far too much into what is a perfectly normal situation, thanks to the moon\u2019s eclipse of Mars. Keep telling yourself that no matter what happens you cannot be harmed. On the contrary, even your mistakes will work out well."}, {"text": "You need to find a way to let off steam without going over the top and annoying those you live and work with. If you have a hobby then put everything into it today. If you don\u2019t have a hobby then maybe it\u2019s time to get one!"}, {"text": "Something of a minor nature will annoy you in a big way today. Others may say you are overreacting, and maybe you are, but in a way you are right to get annoyed as it\u2019s the little things in life that tend to mean the most."}, {"text": "If you go over the top and say or do something excessive today it is important that you forgive yourself. Looking back you may wish you had exercised more self-restraint but Pisces is an emotional sign and you need to be true to your nature."}, {"text": "Never doubt that your values are good values and that your ideas are good ideas. You can and you will make a difference over the coming year, simply by being yourself and giving others a joyous example of how life should be lived to the full."}, {"text": "If you need to build bridges with people you recently fell out with, then now is the time. Partners and loved ones will find it easy to forgive what you said or did but only if you genuinely seem repentant, so make it look good."}, {"text": "It seems as if you cannot put a foot wrong at the moment and that\u2019s great. Even if you do make a mistake it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will care, so do what feels right to you and don\u2019t worry in the slightest what the outcome might be."}, {"text": "You appear to be considerably less anxious about money and business matters now that Venus, planet of harmony, has moved into the most material area of your chart. The interesting thing is that now you are no longer fearful your situation is clearly improving."}, {"text": "Venus in your sign will boost your popularity and enable you to get your way in most things without really trying. Just remember that you will get more in the long-term if you also help others get what they want too \u2013 which is probably the same thing as you."}, {"text": "You may want to do things for other people but your own position must be secure as well. The first step in making the world a better place is to see to it that your heart and mind, and your finances, are in a good place to begin with."}, {"text": "Listen to what friends and colleagues tell you today \u2013 and if what they tell you seems to make sense then act on it immediately. You can be too suspicious at times, Virgo \u2013 not everyone is looking to make a buck at your expense."}, {"text": "Work and career matters are under excellent stars at the moment, so be positive in everything you do. Nothing is more important than your attitude: If others sense that you are serious about your aims they will help you to reach them."}, {"text": "A job you are not looking forward to and would prefer to avoid will turn out to be quite easy, and by the end of the day you could even be enjoying it. Next time, don\u2019t be so eager to persuade yourself that tasks like this can\u2019t be fun."}, {"text": "With Venus, planet of harmony, moving through the area of your chart that governs joint financial matters this would be a good time to approach people who may be able to help you with any long-term money issues you have. If they can, they will help you."}, {"text": "Relationships of all kinds will go well for you over the next few weeks and affairs of the heart in particular will reach new heights of love and affection. You won\u2019t have to make a special effort to impress people though \u2013 they are impressed enough already!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the work and well-being area of your chart means you must not push yourself too hard or take on any new responsibilities over the next few days. You need to relax and let your depleted energy levels build up again."}, {"text": "With both the sun and Venus moving through the most dynamic area of your chart now you can and you must do something out of the ordinary. Make it something that others can relate to and be inspired by. Be a catalyst for change that will last."}, {"text": "The tougher the challenges you face over the coming year the more you will enjoy your successes, of which there will be plenty. Don\u2019t try to avoid what looks difficult, because for you it will be easy. You have hidden talents that have yet to be exploited."}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you stay within your limits this weekend. As Mercury, planet of communication, is about to turn retrograde you won\u2019t be popular if you promise something and then find you cannot deliver it. Be enthusiastic but be realistic, too."}, {"text": "A few kind words from you could be all it takes to cheer up a friend or work colleague who is going through a difficult patch. Remind them that life is supposed to be fun and show them how easy it is to turn a frown into a smile."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t find a solution to your problems by sitting at home brooding about them, so get up, get out and tackle life head on. Someone you meet on your travels could even give you the kind of advice that resolves those problems once and for all."}, {"text": "If you receive a financial offer of some sort over the next few days you must think long and hard about whether it is wise to accept. It may seem like an attractive offer but if it involves a long-term commitment it may not be in your best interests."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication, turns retrograde in your sign this weekend, so don\u2019t be surprised if others don\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d what you are trying to say. The words you use and the words they hear, while one and the same, may not quite match up."}, {"text": "It may appear to other people that you are completely lacking in self-doubt but just below that confident exterior you are in fact rather anxious about what life may be about to send your way. As usual you are worrying for no good reason."}, {"text": "It might be wise not to express your opinions too forcefully now because there is every chance that what you believe today won\u2019t be the same as what you believe in the future. What you think of as \u201cfacts\u201d may not be as set in stone as you think."}, {"text": "If a colleague tries to lay the blame for what\u2019s gone wrong at your door you must reject that claim straight away. If you hesitate for even a second it could sow seeds of doubt in the minds of those who usually trust you to get it right."}, {"text": "As mind planet Mercury is about to begin one of its retrograde phases it\u2019s likely that something you have always believed in will be called into question. Think about the matter by all means but don\u2019t change your opinions yet. Ultimately, you may not have to."}, {"text": "You may trust the people you are dealing with this weekend but you must still check the details and the small print before agreeing to any kind of deal. They could very easily have made a small mistake that could cost big money further down the line."}, {"text": "If there is something you need to say to a loved one then say it today because once Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow it won\u2019t be so easy to put your feelings into words. Also, if you say nothing they may take that to mean they have done something wrong."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to like a person to be able to work with them effectively. If you are smart you will hide your personal feelings this weekend and focus on the task at hand. It\u2019s a task that will require a large number of people to work together."}, {"text": "A number of important and influential people will come into your life over the next 12 months and you must not waste the opportunities they bring with them. That big plan or project you have been working on so long? It\u2019s time to let everyone know."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to let someone get away with a comment that is both untrue and offensive but ask yourself: is it really worth the effort? On this occasion it might be smart to just turn your back and walk away. Contempt works better than conflict."}, {"text": "No matter what it is you want from life you will find a way to get it. You may have to tread on a few toes and bruise a few egos, but that\u2019s okay. Sometimes there really is no alternative than to get up close in someone\u2019s face."}, {"text": "You have no option but to go with the flow and do what others expect of you. Family members and work colleagues are very much in the driving seat at the moment and once you accept that fact you can find ways to make the journey more comfortable."}, {"text": "Most people will do what you ask of them today, but one particular individual is sure to kick up a fuss. Do you kick back or do you ignore them and carry on without their input? Make it the latter. They\u2019re really not worth the effort."}, {"text": "If you get the chance to show what you can do on the work front you must take it, even if it means putting other plans on hold. Others may say you are making a spectacle of yourself but so what? It\u2019s one of the things you do best."}, {"text": "There must be no half measures in what you do today. Both at home and at work you must give 100 per cent, and then you must give a little more. If rivals and competitors have any sense at all they will stay out of your way!"}, {"text": "It seems you are trying to please too many people and do too many things at once, and you should know it won\u2019t work. Take time out today to identify your priorities, and then go for them with everything you\u2019ve got. Ignore the rest."}, {"text": "You may need to flex your muscles a bit and remind certain individuals that you are not the sort of person who can be easily intimidated. Even if someone has more power than you they can be made to back down. Give them the Scorpio stare!"}, {"text": "If you discover something interesting about a friend or colleague today you are strongly advised to keep it to yourself. It may be amusing for you but it could be hugely embarrassing for them. You don\u2019t need to make them feel bad."}, {"text": "What other people think of what you are doing is of no importance. The world is overflowing with busybodies who think they know the answers to everything, but most of the time they actually know nothing, so why would you listen to them?"}, {"text": "You can easily change something about your life that has been annoying you for some time. If it\u2019s a habit of some kind that you want to kick then the best way to get past it is to replace it with a habit of a more positive nature."}, {"text": "Life is too short to worry what other people may think of you, so ignore the mutterings and the nasty looks and get on and do what you know to be right. That does not mean it is right in a general sense, but it\u2019s certainly right for you."}, {"text": "A Mars-Mercury link on your birthday this year will sharpen your thought processes and also your tongue, which could lead to some interesting conversations! Try to approach life in a more light-hearted manner. Above all, use your way with words wisely."}, {"text": "You are entitled to your viewpoint but you are not entitled to demand that other people agree with you. Today\u2019s Mars-Mercury link will give you some pretty strong opinions \u2013 and you will get some pretty strong opinions thrown back at you!"}, {"text": "This is an excellent day for negotiations of all kinds, and if you insist on getting a good deal it\u2019s unlikely that others will want to deny you. They can see that you are serious and don\u2019t want to risk you walking away."}, {"text": "Life is good and getting better by the day, the hour and even the minute. However, Mercury, your ruler, is going through one of its retrograde phases, so you may not see straight as far as money matters are concerned \u2013 and that could be costly."}, {"text": "Both in your personal life and at work you are full of energy at the moment, and that\u2019s great, but you need to focus that energy on activities that will be of benefit to you personally. A little bit of thought will go a long way."}, {"text": "You must not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 cut corners or bend rules today. If you do, you are sure to be found out and the consequences won\u2019t be to your liking. Doing things by the book may be boring but, for the time being, boring is good."}, {"text": "You may not be the type to care what others think of you but with your ruling planet Mercury overshadowed by Mars today, you may be rather touchy about your reputation. Pretend you don\u2019t hear criticism \u2013 and certainly don\u2019t react to it."}, {"text": "Not everyone will approve of your aims and objectives over the next seven days, but don\u2019t let that stop you. Even if powerful people oppose you at work, the omens are still good if you believe in yourself and what you are doing."}, {"text": "Nothing is beyond you now, not a single thing. Do you believe that? You should, because it\u2019s true, and if you exert yourself over the next few days what you accomplish will seem little short of miraculous. For you Scorpio, there are no limits."}, {"text": "You may be finding it hard to keep certain feelings under wraps, but you know if you admit to them you could face trouble from several directions at once. You need to find something uncontroversial to occupy your mind, and your heart."}, {"text": "You may be inclined to say something less than complimentary to someone you feel has let you down but while communications planet Mercury is moving against you that probably isn\u2019t a good idea. Keep your opinions to yourself, at least for now."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that you need to approach what you are working on in a more sensible way. That means, at the very least, that you need to delegate more. You may be best at what you do, but you cannot possibly do it all."}, {"text": "With Mars moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you must find a creative outlet for all that pent-up energy. And make sure it\u2019s a positive outlet. If you start competing with someone, even for fun, the situation could quickly spiral out of control."}, {"text": "The most important thing over the coming 12 months is that you are clear in your own mind what is worth fighting for and what needs to be ignored. You only have so much time and so much energy to give, so be smart and give wisely."}, {"text": "You may not be able to solve the ills of the world, but you can certainly be of assistance. The message of the stars for you today Aries is that you need to get out and about and help those who don\u2019t share your confidence levels."}, {"text": "You still have time to finish a task that should have been completed quite a while ago, but you must get on with it right now and you must not stop until it is done. And don\u2019t just race through it \u2013 make it the best job you\u2019ve ever done."}, {"text": "Work of one sort or another is a dominant theme in your life at the moment but as a Gemini you enjoy the social side of life too, so make time for parties and other events that bring together a lot of different people all in one place."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Saturn link could push you to the limits patience-wise but if you are smart you will resist the urge to get annoyed with someone who simply does not share your levels of commitment or creativity. Not everyone can be you Cancer!"}, {"text": "Tell a friend or family member what they want to hear today, even if you don\u2019t believe a single word of it. The fact is you don\u2019t have time to explain to them why their opinions are wrong \u2013 you have more important things to get finished."}, {"text": "You would be wise to question what you are told by someone in a position of authority, because if it turns out not to be true it is you who will have to take the blame, and foot the bill. Power and common sense are not the same things."}, {"text": "Make your own value judgements today. If you let other people decide for you what is right and what is wrong they will almost certainly do so to suit their own interests. Only you know what matters to you personally, so don\u2019t give your authority away."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if you say or do something silly today. You may not be the sort who can easily shrug off making a fool of yourself but the planets indicate no one will think any the less of you. You\u2019re allowed to be human."}, {"text": "You may think you are in just the right place at just the right time to take advantage of a financial opportunity, and maybe you are, but be careful. Today\u2019s sun-Saturn link warns you could lose more than you gain if you fail to plan properly."}, {"text": "By all means think big but also remember that while Saturn is moving through your sign you cannot afford to take too much for granted. Friends and work colleagues may urge you to \u201cgo for it\u201d today but what is \u201cit\u201d and do you really need it?"}, {"text": "Just because other people know you need assistance does not mean they will supply it without first being asked. On the work front especially you need to let colleagues know that you could do with a helping hand. Be generous with your thanks when you get it."}, {"text": "You may not think much of someone on a personal level, but the fact is they deserve respect on a professional level, and it will reflect badly on you if you fail to accept that and act on it. Remember, you salute the uniform, not the man."}, {"text": "A job worth doing is a job worth getting paid for, so make sure you get what your talents deserve \u2013 and that\u2019s a lot! Certain people may try to shortchange you over the coming year but they won\u2019t succeed \u2013 you simply won\u2019t let it happen."}, {"text": "Just under two weeks from now the sun will move in your favour and one of the best times of the year will begin. Between now and then you must make every effort to get along with other people, especially those you live with. No petty arguments Aries!"}, {"text": "Your workload may increase today, Taurus, but don\u2019t blame other people, blame yourself for agreeing to take on extra responsibilities when you did not have to. Next time, don\u2019t be so nice to people \u2013 let them shoulder their own burdens for a change."}, {"text": "You have more than enough energy to get things done today \u2013 you don\u2019t need other people\u2019s help, still less their approval. Have confidence in your own abilities and don\u2019t be afraid to tackle the kind of problem you have no previous experience of. You\u2019ll excel."}, {"text": "The sun remains in your sign until the 23rd, which gives you more than enough time to finish a project you started with a lot of movement and noise but which now appears to have slowed down almost to a stop. Get it done and dusted!"}, {"text": "According to the planets, you still have a few issues to resolve with a friend or loved one. Like it or not, you are going to have to give ground so that their anxieties can be dealt with. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, so make the effort."}, {"text": "There have been so many changes in your life in recent weeks that it would not surprise you at all if more things changed over the next few days. They will, but maybe not in the way you fear. Chaos will give way to controlled creativity."}, {"text": "If you can be a bit more imaginative and look at an old problem from a new perspective then it won\u2019t be a problem for long. Listen to what your inner voice is trying to tell you and, once you get the message, act on it quickly and decisively."}, {"text": "Ask someone you trust if your latest big idea stands up to scrutiny. Because you have invested so much time and emotional energy in it you may not be best placed to notice if it has any flaws. If they are critical, don\u2019t take it personally."}, {"text": "It might be wise not to make any social plans for the next 24 hours because there are sure to be delays and setbacks and at some stage you will no doubt wonder if the effort was worth it. Instead, why not stay home and relax?"}, {"text": "You need to get your priorities right. Above all you need to stop pursuing an objective that might do something for your ego but could harm your reputation and bank balance. It\u2019s time to get serious, Capricorn. Make the right kind of name for yourself."}, {"text": "The challenge you face now is nothing new \u2013 in fact it is the same kind of challenge you have encountered many times in the past. Once you get past surface differences you will discover it is in fact quite easy to deal with."}, {"text": "It will feel as if a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders over the next few days. Changes over which you have no control will turn your world upside-down but, strangely, that could make it feel as if everything is the right way up again!"}, {"text": "There are two paths you can follow over the coming 12 months: the path of competition and conflict, or the path of cooperation and care. In a quiet moment, ask your heart which one it should be. Or do you already know the answer?"}, {"text": "Someone could say something that hurts your feelings today, but you are advised not to take it to heart because most likely they are motivated by jealousy. You can\u2019t help it if you are more popular, creative and successful than they are. Enjoy their discomfort."}, {"text": "If you have a favour to ask of someone in a position of authority you will most likely get a positive response . . . but they will also want something in return. Is the trade-off worth it? Only you can decide, so give it some careful thought."}, {"text": "There is no point telling you to relax because you can\u2019t \u2013 you are so full of restless energy that you will be on the move, mentally as well as physically, from the moment you wake to the moment you fall into an exhausted sleep. It will be fun, though."}, {"text": "It does not matter how much you may be offered for your services, you must wait a day or two before agreeing \u2013 or not, as the case may be. Don\u2019t let others make you feel guilty because they are suffering while you are not. It\u2019s not your fault."}, {"text": "You may not much like the people you have to deal with today, but your personal feelings are of no importance. The fact is you need them and they need you, so find ways to get along, even if it is only going to be a temporary thing."}, {"text": "You may not be the life and soul of the party at the moment, but don\u2019t let that worry you. Cosmic activity in the most thoughtful area of your chart means you will accomplish more on your own rather than by forcing yourself to be sociable."}, {"text": "Anything is possible for you now Libra, but that does not mean you can just do as you please, nor does it mean you should attempt to do everything at once. To be successful you must be selective, both in your personal affairs and in your work."}, {"text": "If you want to change that\u2019s fine, change. If other people want you to change though that\u2019s a different matter entirely. You have never been the sort to do something just because someone tells you to, so why are you considering it now? Think again."}, {"text": "You may be impatient to get things moving but be warned: If you move too fast you could make a serious mistake. Today\u2019s Mars-Uranus union is also linked with accidents of one kind or another, so slow down and take your time. There\u2019s no need to rush."}, {"text": "The sun in the partnership area of your chart links with Neptune, planet of generosity, encouraging you to be more forgiving, especially with people who don\u2019t share your serious outlook on life. Remember, it takes all sorts to make such an interesting world."}, {"text": "With Mars moving through your opposite sign, it\u2019s unlikely you will be much in the mood for compromise today, but the fact is you will need to give some ground if you intend to reach your goal. Co-operation is a must, whether you like it or not."}, {"text": "You may have to do something today that does not sit easily with the way you like to look at life, but it\u2019s unlikely you will have much say in the matter. Do what is expected of you while also doing what you can to soften other people\u2019s actions."}, {"text": "There may be some tension in both personal and professional relationships over the coming year, but it\u2019s nothing to worry about. It could in fact work in your favour by forcing you to decide what and who really matters. You take too much too seriously."}, {"text": "Watch out you don\u2019t fall for someone who is completely unsuitable for you. Get together and have a good time by all means, but don\u2019t think of taking it any further than that. The planets warn the attachment is likely to end as quickly as it begins."}, {"text": "You may be able to do a task better than anyone else, but that does not mean you have to do it. You clearly have enough on your plate as it is right now, so why make things tough for yourself by taking on yet more responsibility?"}, {"text": "The pressure may be on but you have what it takes to deal with it. Domestic problems, in particular, must not be allowed to get under your skin to the extent that you can think of nothing else. There are more important issues to focus on."}, {"text": "Although you like to pretend you are tough, you are in fact pretty thin-skinned, and what someone says about you today could hurt quite a bit. Do they really mean it? Probably not, but that won\u2019t stop you getting angry inside. Don\u2019t let it show."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to splash the cash on something shiny that catches your eye today, but you will regret it tomorrow when you realize how much it has cost and what else that money could buy. It may not be too late to get a refund."}, {"text": "If you throw yourself into a new plan or project today you will probably be looking for a way out of it tomorrow, so think before you act. Just because others are buzzing here, there and everywhere, Virgo, does not mean you have to do likewise."}, {"text": "Is it possible to be too generous for your own good? Yes it is, and the planets warn you could easily be persuaded to invest a large chunk of your time and cash in something that simply isn\u2019t worth the effort. Be smart and give it a miss."}, {"text": "You must not let your personal feelings interfere with what needs to be done on the work front over the next few days. Some things are public and some things are private and if you don\u2019t know the difference you will need to learn quickly!"}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority may be less than useless as far as you are concerned but bear in mind they have considerably more power than you. You don\u2019t have to agree with what they say but you don\u2019t have to make a fight of it either."}, {"text": "You may be confident that you can handle any kind of crisis but the planets warn that something that comes at you out of left field today could take you by surprise. Get help if you need it \u2013 you don\u2019t have to face challenges alone."}, {"text": "If you make a small change to one thing today it could have a knock-on effect on a number of other things and before you know it everything will be up in the air. Maybe, on this occasion, you should leave things just as they are."}, {"text": "If life seems a bit complicated at the moment it is probably because you are making it complicated for no good reason. You can make things easier for yourself today by refusing to get involved in matters that are of no direct concern to you."}, {"text": "The only thing that can hold you back over the coming year is if you listen to people who are not qualified to give advice. You don\u2019t need to know their opinions \u2013 which is all they are \u2013 you need to listen to your own inner voice. Listen, then act."}, {"text": "You may think you know what\u2019s going on, but the planets warn that seeing is not necessarily believing at the moment, so wait a day or two before making your next big move. You might see things very differently indeed a few days from now."}, {"text": "A friend or colleague will make what sounds like a reasonable suggestion today, but if you act on it chances are you will regret it. It\u2019s highly unlikely they are trying to trick you but it\u2019s quite possible they have been tricked themselves."}, {"text": "Honesty is essential this weekend, especially when dealing with people in positions of authority. No matter how carefully you bend the truth to suit your current situation you are sure to be found out, and the consequences could be costly professionally."}, {"text": "You know what you need to do, but for some strange reason you can\u2019t seem to make a start. It may be frustrating but no doubt there is a good cosmic reason for it. Maybe fate is saving you for something better? You\u2019ll know when the time is right."}, {"text": "Whatever good ideas you have today you are strongly advised to keep them to yourself. The approaching eclipse could make things uncomfortable if it turns out you are not the only one with a brilliant suggestion. Chances are you won\u2019t get the credit."}, {"text": "You need to look at what happens over the next few days coolly and rationally. According to the planets, not only do you have nothing to worry about but you actually have a great deal to look forward to, so why plague yourself with doubts and fears?"}, {"text": "Your ideas may seem strange to some people but the planets indicate that if you have faith in them and follow them through to their logical conclusion you could be on a winner. That\u2019s a winner for you alone, Libra \u2013 don\u2019t share with those who doubt you."}, {"text": "Your thoughts could be rather chaotic over the next 48 hours, so avoid making important decisions, especially if there is money involved. Even if you don\u2019t make a mistake yourself, someone else\u2019s error could lead you astray, so be cautious at all times."}, {"text": "You will get advice from all directions this weekend, but how do you know if it is good advice? You don\u2019t, and the planets warn quite clearly that you will be better off leaving things as they are. Don\u2019t change just because others say you should."}, {"text": "Learn to be more comfortable with who you are and what you do. If you compare yourself to other people it is inevitable that you will feel you have not done enough, but the cosmic fact is you are doing what you should be doing, and doing it well."}, {"text": "The closer you get to Tuesday\u2019s eclipse the more it will nag at you that there may be something you have missed. It\u2019s possible, of course, but it\u2019s unlikely to be important. Find something more positive to think about. Remember, your thoughts possess power."}, {"text": "Can you believe what your inner voice tells you? Well you can certainly believe it more than you can believe other people. This is one of those times when you can and you must question everything you hear. Take nothing for granted over the next 48 hours."}, {"text": "Everyone will know what is best for you this year. Family, friends and even strangers will shower you with advice. Ignore each and every word of it. The only voice that matters is the voice that comes from within, so slow down, calm down \u2026 and listen."}, {"text": "Try not to get sidetracked by trivia today. Focus only on the big picture and the big questions and leave the small stuff to other people. Strive to adopt a wider take on what is going on in the world, even when you don\u2019t agree with it."}, {"text": "Jupiter in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn is a sign of good things to come, but as Jupiter is opposed by the sun today you need to stay in touch with reality. Good things come to those who make an effort, not those who sit back and wait."}, {"text": "Stick to the path you are on and don\u2019t listen to those who say you need to follow a very different route if you want to succeed. Since when has success been the be-all and end-all? Life should be a voyage of discovery, success an afterthought."}, {"text": "Someone you have dealings with over the next few days could be important to you during the rest of the year, so talk to them and be nice to them and find out where they are going in their life. You could be going the same place too!"}, {"text": "Obstacles of one sort or another will make this a tough day to make progress, but if you keep plugging away you will eventually find a route through the maze. Think of it as a cosmic challenge to test your commitment. How much do you really desire success?"}, {"text": "You seem to be labuoring under the impression that negative forces are working against you. But is it an impression or is it an illusion? According to the planets it\u2019s the latter, so lighten up and look for ways to bring more joy into the world."}, {"text": "You may not want to get involved in a fight of some kind but you may have no choice in the matter. Because your sign is associated with fairness you will probably be called on to judge who is right and who is wrong. Expect to be unpopular!"}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to tell anyone where you are going or what you are doing. The more certain people insist that you let them in on your plans the more you must keep those plans to yourself. Would telling them benefit you in any way? Of course not."}, {"text": "Refuse to settle for second best and refuse to accept that certain things cannot be done. Jupiter, your ruler, endows you with huge self-belief and that will be needed today as you battle against those who seem to enjoy bringing doom and gloom into the world."}, {"text": "Saturn in your sign is not the happiest of influences but it is offset to a great extent by Jupiter, planet of joy. It will be your choice today whether to sink into despondency or soar above the pettiness of everyday life. Choose life. Choose love. Choose laughter."}, {"text": "A good deed you did for someone in the dim and distant past will come back to you today. You may not even remember what you did, or why, but the universe has it stored in its memory banks and will insist on doing a good deed for you in return."}, {"text": "An old friend may have let you down in some way but that is not a good enough reason to cut them out of your life. You are at your best when you are most forgiving, so let them know you don\u2019t blame them \u2013 even if, secretly, you do."}, {"text": "You will focus on your goals with such power and intensity over the coming 12 months that success is all but guaranteed. But you need to remember that it\u2019s not all about money and status \u2013 what really matters is how much your love grows."}, {"text": "The approaching lunar eclipse will make those around you more sensitive than usual, so watch what you say during the early part of the week and try not to make promises you may not be able to keep, because that will really make them angry!"}, {"text": "You won\u2019t hesitate to speak your mind over the next few days and what you have to say could do a lot of people a lot of good. But it will also annoy those who prefer to keep things just as they are rather than move with the times."}, {"text": "At some point today you will realize that compromise is not only possible but necessary too. Cosmic activity in one of the more secretive areas of your chart will encourage you to confide in those you love and trust, and they won\u2019t let you down."}, {"text": "The most important thing as the new week begins is that you believe in yourself and trust your own judgment and that you don\u2019t give others the opportunity to direct your actions in any way. You\u2019re in charge and you must stay in charge."}, {"text": "You can easily persuade friends and co-workers to help you out now, so if your current workload is too heavy then get the assistance you need. You don\u2019t have to suffer in silence, not when there are so many people out there who love and admire you."}, {"text": "Some kind of creative difference is likely to raise its head over the next two or three days but that\u2019s okay. In the long-term you will benefit as much, if not more, from advice that is slightly critical rather than advice that is too positive."}, {"text": "You are sure to clash with someone whose opinions you disagree with today, or maybe tomorrow, but you must not back down. The planets warn if you show any sign of weakness they will come back at you again and again, so stand your ground."}, {"text": "You can persuade almost anyone to give you almost anything this coming week \u2013 your way with words will charm rivals and enemies as well as friends and loved ones. Make sure they benefit too though. There\u2019s plenty of good stuff to go round."}, {"text": "You must get firm guarantees that you won\u2019t be out of pocket if a deal you are being asked to take part in goes wrong. If you can\u2019t get those guarantees \u2013 or if you don\u2019t quite believe them \u2013 then keep your money in your pocket."}, {"text": "Because tomorrow\u2019s lunar eclipse takes place in your sign you must not let other people make decisions for you. Listen to advice by all means but don\u2019t assume that because someone occupies a position of power they must know better than you. They don\u2019t."}, {"text": "You may not be much in the mood for fun and games as the new week begins but that\u2019s okay. What you need most now is a bit of space to get your thoughts together and to make sure you are mentally and emotionally prepared for what lies ahead."}, {"text": "Try not to force your ideas and opinions on other people over the next few days. No matter how relevant, or even brilliant, they may be your efforts are unlikely to be appreciated. Never forget that friends and co-workers are entitled to their beliefs as well."}, {"text": "The most important thing you can do over the coming year is to strive not to take life too seriously. Yes, some serious things are going to happen, but the effect they have on you will depend on how you react. Always choose a smile over a frown."}, {"text": "You seem to be in two minds about what it is you should be doing and today\u2019s lunar eclipse is unlikely to make things any easier. Bide your time and look out for pointers as to what your next move should be \u2013 they won\u2019t be long in coming."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s eclipse takes place in one of the better areas of your solar chart but you still need to take care. In particular, don\u2019t get carried away with dreams of success that are unlikely to come true in the foreseeable future. Keep your feet on the ground."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t generally try to watch what you say but the planets warn if you say too much today it could be you who is on the end of some serious criticism. Also, remember you have secrets of your own before revealing embarrassing details about other people."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s lunar eclipse in your opposite sign of Capricorn suggests you will have to deal with some kind of challenge over the next 24 hours, so be on your guard and make efforts to give others the impression that you don\u2019t fear a thing."}, {"text": "Changes in your working environment may be unsettling but you must not let them get to you. It may take a bit of an effort but make sure you look your usual confident self. Also, stay calm even if employers and colleagues give you a hard time."}, {"text": "The best way to tackle an embarrassing situation is to pretend it does not exist. Act as if everything is perfectly normal and that you are at peace with the world, even if on the inside you are seething with anger. Negative emotions must be controlled."}, {"text": "This could be a difficult day, especially on the home front where no matter what you say or do someone is likely to find fault. What you must realize is that their negativity is not really aimed at you but at their own sense of failure, so make allowances."}, {"text": "You are impatient of restriction and will do whatever it takes to be on the move again. However, cosmic activity in the travel area of your chart means you must expect other people to place obstacles in your path. They can slow you down but they can\u2019t stop you."}, {"text": "The most important thing today, and for the rest of the week, is that you steer clear of extremes. Today\u2019s eclipse could have a disastrous effect on your judgment, especially where money is concerned, so keep a clear head and stay calm when under pressure."}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s lunar eclipse falls in your birth sign you could be more emotional than usual, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Usually you are so self-controlled that some people have started to suspect you possess no feelings at all. Prove them wrong."}, {"text": "It\u2019s okay to feel guilty about something, but it\u2019s not okay to let others take advantage of your remorse. If the error was yours then it is up to you to put it right, and you will do that quicker and easier if you close your ears to unhelpful criticism."}, {"text": "Someone whose opinions are at odds with your own will challenge you today and you must meet that challenge head-on. If you try to find a compromise they will take that as a sign of weakness and double their efforts to make you look bad. Fight for your beliefs."}, {"text": "Affairs of the heart are under excellent stars on your birthday but you must not treat love as just a game. One particular relationship needs to be worked on over the coming year and if you get it right then both your days and your nights will be glorious!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t push yourself too hard for the remainder of the week. You will need time to settle down again after the challenges of yesterday\u2019s eclipse, so be good to yourself and, where possible, be good to other people too. Life doesn\u2019t have to be a war."}, {"text": "Someone, or something, will requires your undivided attention today, so push all minor matters to the back of your mind and focus only on what must be done. Remember too that love is more important than success and money, more so now than ever before."}, {"text": "You will find it easy enough to forgive but you must not forget the fact that someone tried to take advantage of you when you were at a low ebb. If they did it once they may try to do it again, so be on your guard at all times."}, {"text": "Venus in your sign brings love and passion into your life but because Venus is opposed by restrictions planet Saturn today, you may find it hard to express yourself. That\u2019s okay. The people who truly matter know how much you care for them."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your time and energy on people and situations that don\u2019t matter, and certainly don\u2019t waste your money on things you don\u2019t need to own. You need to control your emotions today, and you need to keep a tight hold on the purse strings, too."}, {"text": "You seem incredibly romantic of late but there is a danger that you will go too far and make public feelings that should have been kept to yourself. It\u2019s not like you to be this open about the workings of your heart. Whatever has got into you?"}, {"text": "The more you try to impress employers and other important people the more likely it is they will think you are getting too big for your boots, so tone down your act a bit. The people who matter know what you can do, so don\u2019t force it."}, {"text": "Someone who is usually the life and soul of the party seems a bit down at the moment and you should make it your business to bring the smile back to their face. Remind them of the all the good things they have going for them \u2013 including your friendship!"}, {"text": "One way or another you will get your way today but if you are smart you won\u2019t be too forceful, especially with people who are likely to push back if they feel you are being a bit high-handed. Persuade people Sag, don\u2019t try to compel them."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s journey through the relationship area of your chart has brought a number of interesting new people into your life but there is no guarantee they will stick around. If someone you have feelings for needs to move on today you must let them."}, {"text": "If your instincts tell you that a calculated risk of some kind could pay off in a big way then by all means go for it. But if there is money at stake you are advised not to put all your hard-earned cash in one pot. Keep something in reserve."}, {"text": "You seem to enjoy being the centre of attention and can expect the spotlight to be on you for the rest of the week and into the weekend. Make the most of the situation but stay in control as well \u2013 there are more important things than being popular."}, {"text": "Whatever it is you want most in this life you can quite easily bring it into existence over the coming year. Just make sure before you wave your magic wand that it\u2019s what you truly desire, because once it is yours you can\u2019t give it back."}, {"text": "Your thoughts may be on your work and career but you must not neglect matters closer to home. With Venus moving through the domestic sector of your chart you must make time for those you love. Share your dreams and watch them come true together."}, {"text": "Travel and social activities are under excellent stars at the moment, so don\u2019t sit at home watching the TV or wasting your time online, get out into the world and have some good, old-fashioned fun. Wherever you go you\u2019ll be the No. 1 attraction."}, {"text": "Opportunities to improve yourself can be found in almost any direction now, so get up and get at \u2019em and start making things happen. Can it really be that easy? Yes it can \u2013 nothing is beyond your capabilities if you want it and if you strive for it."}, {"text": "Venus in your sign makes a perfect link to Neptune, planet of imagination, so let your mind roam free and give yourself permission to dream. What you visualize now and over the next few days could become your reality in the very near future."}, {"text": "You may not be happy with some of the changes taking place in your world at the moment but the planets suggest you will benefit from them, so keep a low profile and don\u2019t make waves \u2013 or it could be you who falls out of the boat!"}, {"text": "You won\u2019t lack for good ideas today, nor will you lack for the confidence to make use of them, but you must not keep them to yourself. The planets indicate quite strongly that if you are generous with your ideas the payoff will be massive."}, {"text": "If your everyday routine has become a bit too predictable, now is the time to freshen it up a little. Today\u2019s link between Venus, your ruling planet, and Neptune, will give you some ideas as to how to improve the quality of your life, your working life in particular."}, {"text": "Things are going so well for you now that you worry you will suddenly wake up and realize it has all been a dream. The good news is it\u2019s not a dream but reality. The great news is it\u2019s going to get even more dreamlike over the next few days."}, {"text": "Family matters are under excellent stars today, so even if there have been a few harsh words of late you can easily patch things up and get along with loved ones again. Something else to keep in mind: never let money get in the way of romance."}, {"text": "Do something special today, something that you will remember for weeks, months, maybe even years to come. Perhaps the most special thing you can do is to let those you love know just how much they mean to you. Don\u2019t just say it \u2013 prove it."}, {"text": "You seem to be working exceptionally hard of late and that\u2019s good. What\u2019s even better is that you are not primarily working for yourself but for other people. In the fullness of time your generosity of spirit will come back to you in a big way."}, {"text": "Neptune, planet of universal love, links with Venus, planet of personal love, today, so your dealings with people from all walks of life will benefit both them and you in ways you cannot yet understand. Love is, and always will be, the key to everything else."}, {"text": "Mercury moves back into your sign on your birthday, which suggests you have some kind of unfinished business to take care of. What is it that worries you and keeps you awake at night? Make resolving that issue the focus of the coming year."}, {"text": "It may seem as if partners and loved ones are more emotional than usual but only because they have personal issues to deal with that are making them behave erratically. Do what you can to assist them but also give them space to sort themselves out."}, {"text": "The planets indicate you will need to be on top of your game, physically, mentally and emotionally, today and over the weekend. A lot will depend on the attitude you choose to adopt, so be positive and believe you deserve to succeed, and you will."}, {"text": "Forget about what may have gone wrong in the past and focus only on what can go right in the future. Your potential is almost unlimited but it is up to you to make things happen \u2013 the good things in life won\u2019t just fall into your lap."}, {"text": "If you get involved in a friend\u2019s personal issues without them asking you to the results could be dire. The planets warn that those around you are somewhat touchy at the moment, so even if your intentions are noble keep your distance and help from afar."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign endows you with so much energy and so much ambition but as mind planet Mercury slips back into the most sensitive area of your chart today you may lack in self-belief. Keep reminding yourself of all the good things you have to look forward to."}, {"text": "If you have been looking to distance yourself from someone whose presence in your life has become a bit of a burden now is the time to make your move. Choose your words carefully but leave them in no doubt you intend to see less of them."}, {"text": "The pace of life has picked up a lot of late and by and large you have managed to keep up, but in some areas you need to slow down and give more thought to what you are doing and why. Ask yourself: What is the ultimate aim?"}, {"text": "Mars in the career area of your chart is making things happen on the work front but other cosmic influences have got you thinking deeply about your long-term aims. Don\u2019t let your thoughts take over completely though \u2013 ultimately it\u2019s deeds that matter most."}, {"text": "There is a definite luck factor working in your favour at the moment but with mind planet Mercury in one of its retrograde phases you have a tendency to think the worst. What happens today will benefit you in numerous ways, so don\u2019t worry about it \u2013 embrace it!"}, {"text": "If you want to move up in the world then you must take action right now. While your rivals are still considering their options you can be getting way ahead of them by following your instincts and being open to any and all opportunities."}, {"text": "The universe is on your side and wants to help you, but first you must demonstrate that you are ready to risk your comfortable position and strike out in a bold new direction. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Make it a great one."}, {"text": "What other people tell you today may sound sincere but you are strongly advised to read between the lines to get at what it is they really mean. While communications planet Mercury is moving retrograde you must question everything \u2013 everything \u2013 you see and hear."}, {"text": "The most important thing over the coming year is that you communicate clearly and simply when giving instructions, both in your personal life and in your career. Being understood is half the battle \u2013 and the other half is making sure your orders are followed."}, {"text": "A clash of egos is likely this weekend and even though you may not be involved directly you could easily get caught in the middle. Under no circumstances be tempted to take sides, because even if you choose the winning side you might still end up a loser."}, {"text": "You will clash with someone whose viewpoint is pretty much the opposite of your own over the next 48 hours and you must not back down. It may be possible to find areas of agreement but more likely this is a winner-takes-all situation."}, {"text": "You will find yourself up against someone who refuses to see sense today. Don\u2019t waste your time, energy and brain power arguing with them, just let them know what you think, and why, then walk away. There\u2019s no reasoning with some people."}, {"text": "Be careful what you say this weekend, because with communications planet Mercury moving retrograde you could say too much and spend the next few days trying to take back your words. Keep your opinions to yourself, at least for the time being."}, {"text": "Others will most likely tell you what you want to hear rather than what you need to hear over the next 48 hours, so stay alert and don\u2019t be taken in by platitudes and promises. There is only one person whose advice truly matters and that person is you!"}, {"text": "You may think that if you don\u2019t seize an opportunity right now then you will miss out completely but it isn\u2019t that simple. According to the planets you would be wise to bide your time while Mercury, your ruler, is under so much cosmic pressure."}, {"text": "Although you might be confident that what you are working on is going to succeed, not everyone is convinced. A large part of your weekend will be taken up trying to persuade colleagues that you are on the right track and just need to keep going."}, {"text": "Yes, of course, your life is your own and you can do as you please with it, but don\u2019t expect everyone you meet to support your ambitions. Friends and loved ones may be worried for you but once you start making progress their doubts will disappear."}, {"text": "You will need to take extra care when dealing with money matters and business issues this weekend, not least because the planets warn you could get carried away with your big ideas and make an equally big mistake. Get advice from the experts occasionally."}, {"text": "There is every chance that someone will let you down this weekend. The sun close to retrograde Mercury in your opposite sign means you cannot believe what you are told, not even by people you usually trust, so be on your guard in all situations."}, {"text": "If you let your imagination get the better of you over the next 48 hours you could regret it later on when reality brings you crashing back to earth again. Give your mind permission to roam but keep it under reasonable control as well."}, {"text": "If something goes wrong this weekend there are two approaches you can take: You can try to pin the blame on someone else or you can take responsibility and fix it yourself. The latter approach will win you more friends, and get the situation sorted a lot quicker."}, {"text": "Your energy levels will fluctuate over the coming year but it won\u2019t be a problem if you take note of how you are feeling and adapt what you do to fit your level of vitality. No one expects you to be Superman, so don\u2019t expect it of yourself."}, {"text": "Put what other people expect of you out of your mind and focus only on what you expect of yourself \u2013 and you should expect everything. Only you know how high you intend to climb, but the rest of the world will discover soon enough."}, {"text": "If you want something enough you will always find a way to get it, and because other people know that is true they often come to you for assistance. Do what you can for others today but make sure it is morally defensible."}, {"text": "If someone tries to blame their troubles on you today you must not let them get away with it. Even if you feel sorry for them because of the predicament they have got themselves into you don\u2019t need to suffer for it yourself."}, {"text": "You should feel at one with the world at the moment after several weeks of having things pretty much your own way. Keep that feeling going as long as you can but be aware too that there will be new challenges coming up soon."}, {"text": "You could easily get carried away with your own magnificence today, especially if those around you praise you to the skies. It\u2019s good that they believe in you, of course, but watch out they don\u2019t inflate your ego so far it bursts!"}, {"text": "Anything is possible if you want it enough and that is going to be part of your struggle over the next few weeks \u2013 actually wanting what you know you can get. While your material ambitions are certainly important, your spiritual outlook is what truly matters."}, {"text": "Go where your instincts take you today and be ready to change course at the drop of a hat. If you think the changes that have been taking place of late have been interesting, wait until you see what the universe serves up next!"}, {"text": "Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts and feelings over the next 24 hours. If you allow the ceaseless chatter of the outside world to constantly bombard your senses you may never come to any worthwhile decisions."}, {"text": "What you say in public and what you believe in private will be two completely different things today. You are smart enough to know that there are some things it is not prudent to say, at least not until the world has caught up with your thinking."}, {"text": "If an opportunity of some kind comes your way today you must take advantage of it fully and instantly. If you hesitate for even a few seconds you may find that someone nips in ahead of you and seizes what should have been yours."}, {"text": "This is a good time to stand back from what you are working on and ask yourself if it remains true to your original design. If you are still happy with it then carry on. But if it could be better in some way then make a few adjustments."}, {"text": "Put principles before profit today and make sure others don\u2019t lose out if you gain in some way. More than any other sign you are sensitive to other people\u2019s suffering, so see to it that all your actions are guided by compassion."}, {"text": "Your energy levels, both physical and mental, will surge over the coming 12 months and it\u2019s important that you find a positive outlet for all your pent-up ambition. What is the highest ideal you can think of? Aim for that and refuse to ever go lower."}, {"text": "Be careful as the new week begins that you don\u2019t accidentally make an enemy of someone who thinks your criticism of them is unjustified. They recognize that you can be rather blunt at times but this time you really do risk going too far."}, {"text": "If you find yourself at odds with someone you live or work with today you are strongly advised not to let the situation get out of hand. The planets warn that once a certain point is reached compromise will no longer be an option for either of you."}, {"text": "If someone offers to do you a favour today you would be wise to find out what they expect from you in return. Don\u2019t believe them if they say they are doing it out of the goodness of their heart \u2013 there is sure to be a deeper motive."}, {"text": "Just because others find it hard to live up to your standards does not mean you can ignore them yourself. On the contrary, it becomes even more important that you provide a lead and show them that if you can be strong then they can be too."}, {"text": "The old solar cycle is coming to an end and when the sun moves into your sign tomorrow you can and you must draw a line under the past and begin anew. Start by having a serious throw out of things you no longer use and will never need."}, {"text": "A stressful start to the week may be likely as certain individuals, especially on the work front, seem determined to be unhelpful, obstructive and even hostile. There are times when you must fight for what is right for you personally and this is one of them."}, {"text": "You will find it hard to get your way as the new week begins, but that\u2019s okay. As the sun changes signs tomorrow you will have no choice but to raise your game and become more competitive. You can\u2019t be a nice guy all the time Libra!"}, {"text": "It will pay you to check the small print on documents carefully today, especially when dealing with work-related matters. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone is trying to cheat you but mistakes have been known to happen, so be on your guard at all times."}, {"text": "Whatever you are currently working on you are advised to let it sit for a day or two before pushing ahead again. Once the sun moves in your favour tomorrow you may find you don\u2019t have to make much of an effort \u2013 others will do it for you."}, {"text": "You seem determined to prove yourself at the moment, which is strange because no one has suggested that you are not good enough. Nothing bad will happen so long as you keep your competitive instincts under control. You don\u2019t have to win everything!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if what you have been working on these past few weeks seems to have come to a halt. Most likely you simply need to adjust the way you look at it and the sun\u2019s imminent change of signs will help you do that."}, {"text": "By all means set yourself targets but don\u2019t make them so outrageous that you are playing catch-up right from the start. The sun in Cancer these past few weeks has raised your sights considerably, and that\u2019s good, but you must keep a sense of perspective."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that you will profit from other people\u2019s misfortunes this year, but you must not allow yourself to feel bad about it. Life is full of ups and downs and if it\u2019s your turn to be on the rising side of the curve then by all means enjoy it."}, {"text": "Life is about to get a lot busier than it has been of late, but in a good way. As the sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart, creative ideas will come thick and fast and soon you will be working on something big \u2013 and profitable."}, {"text": "A dispute can be resolved quite easily today but it is up to you to make the first move and get everyone together so you can thrash out a deal. Make an effort to see every viewpoint and don\u2019t think others are stupid just because they don\u2019t agree with you."}, {"text": "It will be up to you to play the peacemaker over the next 24 hours as friends and family members take very different views on what needs to be done. However, if your best attempts to mediate fall flat then withdraw your services and let them get on with it."}, {"text": "You no longer have either the time or the patience to play silly games. As the sun moves out of your sign today you must not waste a second on people who carry around too much emotional baggage. Either they grow up or you move on."}, {"text": "What other people think, say or do is no longer of any importance \u2013 as the sun begins its annual journey through your birth sign today the only opinions that matter are the ones you give to the world. And, as always, you will have plenty to say!"}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you take a break and give both your mind and your body time to recover from recent events. Not even a Virgo can operate on the edge indefinitely, so be kind to yourself and take a vacation. You deserve it!"}, {"text": "On the creative level this is potentially one of the best days of the year for you. It will be even better if you seek out people who share your aims and ambitions and pool your resources, both mental and physical. Together you will be unbeatable."}, {"text": "As the sun moves into the career area of your chart today you must strive to be a bit more ambitious. Someone important has got their eye on you and if they like what they see this could be the start of a hugely successful phase."}, {"text": "If you need inspiration then what happens today will make life interesting again. However, if you want it to stay interesting you will have to adjust the way you choose to look at the world. Never forget that it\u2019s your mind which creates your reality."}, {"text": "How serious are you about a relationship? That question will nag at you today and it\u2019s obvious that at some stage you are going to have to choose whether to carry on with it or walk away once and for all. Only you can decide."}, {"text": "The next few weeks are going to be mainly about relationships and, more importantly, how you choose to deal with them. Promise yourself that no matter what happens you won\u2019t let your emotions dictate your responses. Listen to your heart but use your head."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that between now and the end of the week you will come under fire from someone who does not agree with your opinions, and it\u2019s essential that you stick up for yourself and what you believe. If you don\u2019t, then who will?"}, {"text": "You have never been afraid to speak your mind or stand up for what you believe and you will be doing a lot of both this year. Speak from the heart and act with conviction, and do battle with those who don\u2019t share your passion for truth and justice."}, {"text": "If you find yourself involved in a debate of some kind today you must fight your corner but you must not bend the truth, not even a little. If you want to be taken seriously you must stick to the facts. Even the smallest untruth will undermine your arguments."}, {"text": "Others may not appreciate what you tell them today but don\u2019t let that stop you. It is important that someone is prepared to face reality head on and if no one else is minded to do it then that someone will have to be you. The truth matters."}, {"text": "You will meet some interesting people over the next few days and you may be tempted to give up on what you are working on and work with them instead. Don\u2019t. It may not be obvious yet but the planets warn they are somewhat unreliable."}, {"text": "Be careful what you agree to today and tomorrow, especially if there is money at stake. Cosmic activity in the main financial area of your chart warns you cannot believe everything you hear. Even the so-called experts could get it wrong in a big way."}, {"text": "Your head may be full of brilliant ideas but you are advised not to do anything with them yet. Give the sun time to move deeper into your birth sign before you make your move. The more you plan ahead now the more successful you will be later on."}, {"text": "You may find yourself beset by fears that make no sense at all, and if you are you must ignore them. Mercury is undergoing one of its retrograde phases at the moment, which means you cannot trust your own mind. Be positive at all times and in all situations."}, {"text": "No matter how hard you strive to persuade those you live and work with that you know what you are talking about they won\u2019t completely trust you. That may be annoying but try seeing things from their point of view. They\u2019ve got more to lose than you have."}, {"text": "This could be a frustrating day, especially on the career front where employers and other important people don\u2019t seem to care about the efforts you have been making. But why let that worry you? You know your own worth, so what else matters?"}, {"text": "Travel plans may have to be put on hold over the next few days but it could be a blessing in disguise. You are so eager to get moving again that you could easily make a false start or a costly mistake, so take your time and get it right."}, {"text": "What you hear over the next 24 hours may not delight you but neither will it be as negative as you initially fear. What you need to remember is that consequences always come from causes, so find out the reasons for this piece of bad news."}, {"text": "Someone, somewhere needs your help and once you realize that fact you will rush to their assistance. However, once you have solved their dilemma you must let them know that next time it happens they will be on their own. Make sure they learn."}, {"text": "You may be of the opinion that something that occurs today is of only minor importance, even laughable \u2013 and maybe to you it is \u2013 but other people are likely to take it very seriously indeed, so don\u2019t make light of it within their hearing range."}, {"text": "You will need to take extra care when dealing with money matters and business issues over the coming year, not least because you will have a tendency to rush into new projects with so much enthusiasm that you forget about the costs. Nothing comes for free."}, {"text": "You\u2019ll be in a dynamic sort of mood today as Mars links with Jupiter across two of the most positive areas of your chart. Anyone who thinks you talk a lot but don\u2019t follow up with action is about to be proved wrong in a very big way."}, {"text": "A certain amount of criticism is to be expected today but you should simply ignore it. The more others complain that you have been neglecting their needs the more likely it is they want you to do something that is not in your interests. Don\u2019t be fooled."}, {"text": "Make the effort to get out and about over the next 24 hours, because someone you meet in the course of your travels could become a hugely important contact in the near future. Try to avoid being too independent \u2013 you\u2019re at your best as a people person."}, {"text": "The sun has left your sign but that does not mean you can ease up. You have built up a considerable head of steam in recent weeks and you should aim to keep it going as long as possible \u2013 to the end of the month at the very least."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign now links with Jupiter, planet of expansion and enthusiasm, which means your energy levels will be extremely high. It does not matter how many things you have on the go over the next few days, you will finish them all with ease."}, {"text": "You have so many plans and so much potential but are allowing silly fears and phobias to hold you back. Make it your aim today to push yourself through whatever mental and emotional barriers have been erected between you and your goals."}, {"text": "The reason someone is being so critical of your efforts is because they are jealous of your popularity and success. You cannot stop them being so negative but you can ignore them and carry on as you are \u2013 which, with luck, will enrage them even more!"}, {"text": "An extremely busy phase is about to begin and it is important that you know what direction you are going to be moving in and what obstacles you are likely to face along the way. Not one of those obstacles can stop you, or even slow you down."}, {"text": "One of the most productive times of the year has now begun and with your ruler Jupiter on good terms with energy planet Mars today you can accomplish more over the next 24 hours than you managed to finish over the previous month. So get on with it!"}, {"text": "You may believe in yourself and what you are doing 100 per cent but certain people don\u2019t share your positive attitude. Do you take time out of your busy schedule to win them over? No you do not. Your success does not depend on their support."}, {"text": "Try not to say anything that could cause a fight today as Mars in your opposite sign makes other people ridiculously touchy. It doesn\u2019t matter if your words annoy them but it does matter if they then try to block your progress, so be smart."}, {"text": "It does not matter how many brilliant ideas you have flying around that big brain of yours, the question is: what are you going to do with them? Focus on the one or two ideas that mean the most to you and leave the rest for another day."}, {"text": "The quicker you learn to adapt to new methods and routines the sooner you will be able to move ahead professionally and financially. Make it your number one aim over the coming 12 months to move with the times \u2013 or even be ahead of them, if possible."}, {"text": "It will pay you to be a bit more accepting of people who don\u2019t share your drive and ambition. Not everyone possesses your can-do, get-it-done nature (if they did you wouldn\u2019t be so special), so make allowances while still making your natural talents count."}, {"text": "You seem to be much in demand at the moment, which is nice, but can you be sure it is for the right reasons? The planets warn that some of those who want to get close to you have motives that are anything but positive. Learn to spot the frauds."}, {"text": "If you gain from someone else\u2019s misfortune there is no reason why you should feel bad about it. In the game of life there are always going to be winners and losers and for the time being at least you are one of the lucky ones, so enjoy it."}, {"text": "You may be having second thoughts about what course you should be taking in the immediate future but don\u2019t dwell on the matter to such an extent that you worry yourself sick. What happens over the next few days will point you in the right direction."}, {"text": "This is your time of year and you have every right and every reason to make the most of it. The sun and Mars in your sign will encourage you to go beyond your limits and explore new possibilities, the number of which are now almost endless."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to say \u201cno\u201d to someone who asks you for a favor but the fact is you don\u2019t have much choice in the matter. There is no telling how their current situation will work itself out, so be smart and err on the side of caution."}, {"text": "You prefer to be honest in your dealings with other people but it will pay you to be a little bit devious today. Whatever it is you are after, make it seem as if you want something completely different \u2013 that way there will be less competition."}, {"text": "If you want your efforts to be more effective then you need to have a major clear out of all the things in your life that you no longer need. Anything that seems to be holding you back from furthering your career aims has got to go \u2013 right away!"}, {"text": "You may want to be lenient with someone who has let you down, but if you do there is every chance they will let you down again, so pretend to be angry and make sure they know their behavior is unacceptable. They\u2019ll thank you for it one day."}, {"text": "Just because you have all the facts on your side does not mean you are going to win an argument. What truly matters is the passion you bring to what you are saying. The fact that counts most is that emotions very often win the day."}, {"text": "If you want to stay on good terms with others today you are advised not to be too demanding, even if your demands are nothing special. At this time of year more than most your success depends as much on other people as it does on your own efforts."}, {"text": "The one thing you must not do now is take on any new responsibilities. With the sun and Mars in the work area of your chart you are doing more than your fair share as it is, so for the sake of your wellbeing refuse to do any more."}, {"text": "A Mars-Saturn link on your birthday means you need to work out when it is right to act and when it is right to wait. If you call it correctly the rewards will be massive. If you call it wrong you could find you lose more than you gain."}, {"text": "Yes, someone you are depending on is dragging their feet for no good reason, but no, you must not allow yourself to get angry about it.

Don\u2019t fall for it \u2013 stay calm."}, {"text": "You may be in two minds about getting involved in some kind of social activity this weekend, but if you make the effort you will thoroughly enjoy it. However, if it gets a bit competitive you may need to remind yourself that it\u2019s still just a game."}, {"text": "Saturn in the wealth area of your chart warns you need to be careful when dealing with money matters. Even if you know what you are doing there could be something small you have overlooked and that something small could have big consequences."}, {"text": "Just because you are in the right does not mean you are guaranteed to get your own way. The planets warn if you come on too strong or push too hard this weekend you could trigger a reaction from people who can make life difficult for you. "}, {"text": "You have no intention of sitting on the fence and watching the world go by, and that\u2019s great, but you also need to remember that there are other people involved in your world and their aims may be at odds with your own. Think of that before you act."}, {"text": "If a friend or family member says something you don\u2019t want to hear over the next 48 hours you may be inclined to close your ears and pretend it never happened. That would be a mistake. What they have to tell you could in fact be of massive value."}, {"text": "With both the sun and Mars moving through one of the more positive areas of your chart at the moment you don\u2019t lack for self-belief, but you may at times lack self-control, so try standing back occasionally from what you are doing \u2013 then you will do it better."}, {"text": "This could be one of those times when your calm exterior begins to crack under pressure, so be good to yourself and don\u2019t expect too much, either of yourself or other people. Remember, life is what it is, not necessarily what you want it to be."}, {"text": "If you try to force other people to do things they don\u2019t want to do this weekend you could stir up a whole heap of trouble. With Mars on your side you may be able to get your way in some situations but in others the backlash could be severe."}, {"text": "Saturn in your sign is going through one of its retrograde phases, which means if you forget what your limits are the consequences won\u2019t be to your liking. Ignore those who try to encourage you to take unnecessary risks. They want to see you fail."}, {"text": "Despite what you may think no one is out to get you or make you look bad. For some unknown reason you appear to believe there is some kind of conspiracy to deny you the success you crave, but it isn\u2019t true. Try being a little less paranoid!"}, {"text": "Differences of opinion with partners and loved ones may make this a more intense weekend than it needs to be. Whenever voices start to sound angry try removing yourself from the scene until it blows over. You don\u2019t have to get personally involved."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, push yourself harder in search of fame and fortune, but why expend all that energy when you don\u2019t have to? Your birthday chart urges you to believe that everything you desire will come your way \u2013 and your belief will make it a fact."}, {"text": "Social activities and travel are well-starred, but don\u2019t wander too far from home. If you are looking for love you are likely to find it some place you have not been to before, but chances are it will still be in your general neighbourhood."}, {"text": "Venus, your ruler, is currently moving through the money area of your chart, but it\u2019s not all about dollars and cents \u2013 romance is important too.

On the contrary, the slower you move the more effective your efforts will be."}, {"text": "Something you have been worrying yourself sick over is really of no importance at all, and once you recognize that fact you will feel such a sense of relief that your spirits soar. Maybe the world is not such a bad place after all."}, {"text": "Spend time with people who share your positive outlook on life. No matter how serious the things going on in the world around you seem to be there is always a reason to laugh, and you are more likely to find that reason in the company of friends."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of authority wants you to believe they know what they are talking about, but you can sense they do not. If in doubt, do the very opposite of what they suggest \u2013 that way you are more likely to get it right."}, {"text": "You seem to be friends with everyone at the moment, and that\u2019s great, but don\u2019t spend so much time with strangers that you neglect those closest to you. You are related to certain people for a good cosmic reason, so make sure they are central to your plans."}, {"text": "You are not the sort to waste money on trivial things, but the planets suggest you may splash out today. If it makes you feel good then it cannot be bad, but whatever you buy make sure you keep the receipt, in case you want to return it later."}, {"text": "Venus in the partnership area of your chart means you can easily resolve outstanding fights and feuds, but only if you want to. It may be that you quite enjoy the tension that is created by minor disagreements \u2013 and tension can also be creative."}, {"text": "Try not to push yourself too hard today. Most things you need will come easy to you now, so why exert too much energy? As for the things you don\u2019t need, why would you want them cluttering up your life more than it is cluttered already?"}, {"text": "Life is good and getting better by the moment, and that applies double, triple even, to affairs of the heart. Venus in the most romantic area of your chart will help you overcome your inhibitions and let someone special know just how much you care."}, {"text": "If you go over the top in an effort to impress someone you have feelings for your efforts may not bring the results you desire. Why? Because they don\u2019t want to feel they are being pressured. Try to take a more relaxed approach to relationships today."}, {"text": "A sun-Uranus link on your birthday this year will encourage you to change a number of things that have become boring and stale \u2013 but don\u2019t change everything. The foundations of your life are still strong and give you a platform on which you can build."}, {"text": "Although you may be drawn toward a total stranger today you must play it cool and you must find out as much about them as you can before you allow yourself to get any closer emotionally. The planets warn that the initial attraction could quickly fade."}, {"text": "The time has come to put disputes and disagreements with a particular person behind you once and for all and move on either together or on your own.

Whatever else you do, try not to annoy them."}, {"text": "It seems that the more you try to change things in your life the more they stay the same, which is no doubt frustrating, but it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Looking back a few weeks from now you may be glad that time stood still!"}, {"text": "Everyone worries about money but you seem to be obsessing about every last dollar and cent, and that isn\u2019t healthy. The message of the stars for the coming few days is that your mental and emotional energy would be better employed elsewhere."}, {"text": "The old always gives way to the new whether you want it to or not, so instead of trying to hold on to what is slipping out of your life just let it go and move on to something better. Its departure will give you room to grow and prosper."}, {"text": "There is nothing you cannot do if you put your mind to it now. You not only have a talent for thinking up new ways of doing things but you also have the courage to get on and do them without fear of failure \u2013 which guarantees success."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t get many thanks for helping a friend out of a hole today but that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not in it for the glory, you\u2019re in it to make a difference, and if you can make a difference for just one person then the whole world gains too."}, {"text": "Your ideas carry more weight with employers and other important people than you seem to realize and the planets indicate that what you have to tell them today will have a huge impact on their future decisions. So make sure it\u2019s good advice!"}, {"text": "You may be limited in what you can do socially over the next few days but don\u2019t let it worry you. Uranus, planet of changes, will bring unexpected delays and setbacks but in the fullness of time you will understand they were part of a wider plan."}, {"text": "A Mars-Neptune link on your birthday will help you dream up new ways of making money and getting ahead in the world, but be careful. There are smart big ideas and there are stupid big ideas and the dividing line may not always be easy to recognize."}, {"text": "Take care you don\u2019t get carried away and cross a line which people in positions of power are in no mood to see ignored. Sometimes your energy and enthusiasm leads you to do things that are unlikely to be of benefit to you in the long-term."}, {"text": "Others won\u2019t play fairly today, but now that you know that you can take evasive and defensive action. One thing you must not do though is copy their tactics. You have higher standards than your rivals and if you forget that then it\u2019s a victory for them."}, {"text": "By all means speak up and say your piece but don\u2019t expect others to take much notice. Your ultimate aim is not to convince or convert anyone but to get into the public domain information that you know is important.

Tone down your act a bit and try to think before you speak and act."}, {"text": "Put your own needs first today and ignore those who say you should do more for others than you do for yourself. What they don\u2019t seem to realize is that your successes will improve the life experiences of so many other people. Everything is linked."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s Mars-Neptune link could lead to some serious doubts about what you are doing, which in turn could have a negative effect on your future plans. You need to push past your fears and trust that the universe will guide you in the right direction."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to act on what loved ones tell you \u2013 you can, if you wish, follow your instincts and do your own thing. Of course, if you get it wrong they are sure to say \u201cI told you so\u201d \u2013 but you won\u2019t get it wrong, you\u2019ll get it right."}, {"text": "You must assert yourself more and let important people know what you are capable of. If you can manage that over the next few days then you could find yourself moving up the ladder of success at quite a speed. Let them see your drive and hunger."}, {"text": "You may have big plans but are they the kind of plans that stand a realistic chance of success?

Don\u2019t make a move if your information is limited \u2013 it could end in tears."}, {"text": "A clash with someone who thinks with their heart rather than their head is likely today but it\u2019s a fight you need to have. You know where you stand on various issues but you need to make sure other people know too, so there can be no mistakes."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, push yourself even harder mentally and physically over the next few days, but the results will be minimal. What matters now is quality, not quantity, so take a long, hard look at what you are doing \u2013 and then start doing less."}, {"text": "You can expect some major surprises over the next 12 months and all of them will be beneficial. It may at times seem as if the opposite is true but look deeper and you will discover that each and every event is moving you closer to your goals."}, {"text": "If you make a point of seeing the bright side in each and every situation then the next few days should be truly fantastic. Tomorrow\u2019s new moon will bring with it information that will inspire you to believe that you can do what others say cannot be done."}, {"text": "There may be times today when you find it hard to get along with a loved one but it\u2019s no big deal, so don\u2019t start believing that you are drifting apart. Everyone has moments like these and your relationship will not only survive but be stronger for it."}, {"text": "The approaching new moon suggests you may need to change direction suddenly over the next few days, but being the sort of person who enjoys a bit of variety that shouldn\u2019t be any great problem. Just don\u2019t get into the habit of changing for the sake of it."}, {"text": "You may feel a bit restricted in what the powers that be allow you to do but there are still plenty of opportunities to shine and show your worth. In the fullness of time you may even be relieved that some of your plans were not allowed to develop."}, {"text": "You must aim high over the next two or three days. Not only is there a new moon in your sign but mind planet Mercury starts moving in your favour again, so you won\u2019t lack for big ideas, nor the big heart needed to turn dreams into realities."}, {"text": "You may not be the most emotional member of the zodiac but you have your moments and over the next two or three days you may be surprised by how easily you are affected by what\u2019s going on in the world around you. Don\u2019t take it personally, though"}, {"text": "You may have no end of good ideas buzzing around that big brain of yours but most will come to nothing as you cannot possibly do it all. However, one particular idea could make your fortune. You know what it is, so focus on that one idea alone."}, {"text": "Dealings with employers and people in authority could be a bit tough over the next few days, so promise yourself now that you will keep your emotions in check no matter what happens. Also, try to understand that criticism is not a bad thing if you learn from it."}, {"text": "It\u2019s okay to take a few risks, especially if you have worked out the odds and know what your chances of success are likely to be. Your rivals will be stunned by how quickly you act and how quickly you recover from setbacks, few as they are."}, {"text": "You may not have much choice about what you are expected to do today but how you do it is up to you entirely. One of the things people admire about you is your professionalism, so do what you have to do and do it better than everyone else."}, {"text": "The more you let partners and family members know how much you care the more they will respond to you with love and kindness themselves. You sometimes find it hard to express your affection but over the next few days your loving nature will be to the fore."}, {"text": "There are still a number of important tasks that need to be finished before you can move on to something new, so get started on them early today and aim to have them done by when the sun goes down. After that your time will be your own again."}, {"text": "If you change just one small thing on your birthday this year you will change your whole life for the better \u2013 and the lives of everyone you come into contact with over the next 12 months. For best results, be the change you want to see in the world."}, {"text": "If you want something enough today you will find a way to get it, even if some of the people you live and work with don\u2019t want you to have it. A new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart means you just won\u2019t be denied."}, {"text": "Upheavals on the home front are likely over the next 24 hours, but there is no need to worry about it, still less to panic. The fact is that certain changes are long overdue and you need to be pushed to make changes that both matter and last."}, {"text": "With a new moon in the communications area of your chart and Mercury, your ruler, moving in your favour again you will have plenty to say for yourself today. You\u2019re unlikely to face much opposition, simply because others can\u2019t get a word in!"}, {"text": "Your attitude to money and possessions will undergo something of a transformation over the next few days, and that\u2019s good. You need to realize that your worth is not measured by what you own or earn but by how you deal with and treat other people."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon in your sign makes this one of the most important days of the year and although what occurs may be disruptive it will also be hugely beneficial. Today is the first day of the rest of your life \u2013 and life will be good to you."}, {"text": "Certain beliefs are holding you back and you need to get rid of them. As Mercury, your ruler, ends its retrograde phase today you should be a lot more positive in your outlook and that\u2019s good. But don\u2019t just think about the future \u2013 make it happen."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t bother trying to explain your actions to other people, just get on and do what you know to be right and let them work it out for themselves. If you are true to your beliefs then nothing and no one can stop you from reaching your goals."}, {"text": "Something to do with your career or your social standing will change over the next 24 hours and it is sure to be a change for the good. Don\u2019t listen to those who say you are aiming too high \u2013 on the contrary, you cannot possibly aim high enough."}, {"text": "This is one of the most important days of the year for you and if you have the courage to follow your dream there is no limit to what you might accomplish. The word \u201ccannot\u201d must be banished from your vocabulary. You can and you will be a success."}, {"text": "Are you using the gifts you were born with to their full effect? If you are honest you will admit that you could be doing more and you could be doing better \u2013 and if you start doing better right now you will soon be the very best."}, {"text": "Something will happen over the next 24 hours that you could not have predicted, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. On the contrary, even if you are forced by circumstances to move in a radically new direction you will soon discover it is a direction you enjoy."}, {"text": "Your working routine is likely to be disrupted today or tomorrow and while in the short term you may find it frustrating over a longer period of time you will recognize that it worked very much in your favor. All change is good change from a higher perspective."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t do what you do for your own benefit alone. The more you try to improve the life experiences of other people the more you will discover the joy that comes from seeing friends and family, and even work colleagues, make something good of their lives."}, {"text": "New faces and new places will play a large part in your life today and over the weekend, so be ready for anything and especially be ready to move at a moment\u2019s notice. Don\u2019t waste time saying your goodbyes, just hit the road and enjoy yourself."}, {"text": "What you believe in may seem perfectly sensible to you but others are not so sure, so be ready to face criticism from people who do not share your ideals or outlook on life. But don\u2019t let that criticism stop you \u2013 always be true to yourself."}, {"text": "Everything seems right with the universe at the moment and over the next two or three days that feeling is sure to continue. If you are on the move in any way your path will be smooth and the people you meet will be fun, so don\u2019t hurry."}, {"text": "If you feel uncomfortable with what you are being asked to do then simply refuse to do it. No one has the power to force you to act in ways that go against your principles, so be brave and say \u201cno\u201d if you know it\u2019s the right thing to do."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your time and energy arguing with people whose beliefs and opinions are very different to your own \u2013 you have as much chance of changing the way they look at the world as they do of changing yours. That\u2019s what makes life so much fun."}, {"text": "Someone you meet today or over the weekend will make a huge impression on you, so much so that you may decide you want to be like them in every way. That cannot happen. Why? Because they are unique and so are you. Try being yourself instead."}, {"text": "The important thing today is that you don\u2019t take what happens too seriously. Yes, of course, there are some major things going on in your world but allowing yourself to get worked up about them won\u2019t help in the slightest. Keep your distance emotionally."}, {"text": "Minor irritations must not be allowed to become major irritations, and the best way to make sure of that is to stay calm and, if possible, stay out of the way of people whose attitude rubs you up the wrong way. You don\u2019t have to play their games."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that you will get more done today if you take a relaxed view of other people\u2019s faults and failings. They can\u2019t help who they are, any more than you can, so stay cool and accept that you won\u2019t always get things your own way."}, {"text": "No matter how many wrong turnings you have taken of late you still seem to be on the right path, so why are you worrying so much? As the month of August progresses you will find that the less you worry about life the more you enjoy it."}, {"text": "Always look on the bright side, even when dark events appear to be happening all around you. The fact is you can see only part of the cosmic picture and if you could see it all you would understand in an instant how it all fits together."}, {"text": "It may at times feel as if you have no control over the events of your life but is it really that bad? Probably not. The message of the stars today is that you should try to feel a bit less and think a bit more. Common sense is essential."}, {"text": "Are you using your talents wisely? Are you reaching your full potential? Like most people there is probably more you can do, but unlike most people you now have a real opportunity to step up a gear. Don\u2019t settle for average Leo \u2013 be the very best."}, {"text": "Surprises of one kind or another will make this an interesting weekend and if you don\u2019t take what happens too seriously you will actually have a lot of fun. Others may not be amused by your ability to laugh at the absurd but that itself is worth a grin."}, {"text": "Try not to take what other people say too personally, not even if it is clearly about you. They are just trying to make a point about how it can sometimes be hard to get through to you \u2013 because you can be a bit too fixed in your opinions."}, {"text": "Forget about work and forget about money issues and focus on affairs of the heart over the next 48 hours. Human relationships are far more important than the kind of everyday, mundane things you have been expending so much time and energy on."}, {"text": "You have been working far too hard and need to take a break. The thing to remember though is that no one will give that break to you, you have to make it happen yourself. Announce that you are off for a long weekend, and then just go!"}, {"text": "This could be and should be a wonderful time for you and about the only thing that might spoil it is if you listen to people whose attitude is a bit more negative than your own. Even if they have a valid point you don\u2019t have to embrace it."}, {"text": "There is nothing you can do about a loved one\u2019s irrational behaviour, so don\u2019t bother trying. Give them a wide berth this weekend and hope that their stupidity \u2013 for that\u2019s what it is \u2013 burns itself out before the new week begins. Chances are it will."}, {"text": "There will be both good news and bad news this weekend, but the good will far outweigh the bad. The more you get out into the world and do things with your friends and with family members the more you will enjoy yourself \u2013 so get moving!"}, {"text": "Whatever your current situation may be and whatever challenges you may face you can and you must believe that greatness awaits you. The sun in the career area of your chart will inspire you to do something outstanding. No one will ever doubt you again."}, {"text": "Pleasant surprises will come thick and fast this weekend, and perhaps the most pleasant of all will be that someone you have admired from afar clearly thinks highly of you as well. What starts as a friendship could quickly develop into something more intense."}, {"text": "Do you give in meekly when faced with overwhelming odds, or do you fight even harder than you fought before? Being the ambitious sort you should be able to see that now is not the time to hang back but to push even harder than before. Go for it!"}, {"text": "Put your own needs first and don\u2019t listen to those who say you are being selfish. Maybe you are, but why not when you have done so much for other people already? Identify what it is you want more than anything else, then go all out to get it."}, {"text": "You may have to do something a bit unpleasant this weekend but it needs to be done and it needs to be you who does it. Your awareness of your own needs is matched by an understanding of what is best for others. Be sympathetic but be ruthless too."}, {"text": "A Mars-Jupiter link on your birthday will endow you with no end of energy and ambition, but you need to be aware that it will bring challenges too. Be wary of people who say they admire your successes but would really prefer to see your efforts fail."}, {"text": "Anyone who asks for your opinion regarding what\u2019s going on in the world had better be prepared to hear a few home truths. You are in no mood to pull your punches or sugar-coat your criticisms, of which, as always, you have plenty."}, {"text": "You will have to deal with someone whose attitude is not to your liking \u2013 in fact they annoy you intensely. Like it or not your fates are currently entwined, so all you can do is stay calm and not let your temper get the better of you."}, {"text": "If someone tells you something cannot be done today you will do everything in your power to prove them wrong. However, a dangerous looking Mars-Jupiter link warns you may not have as much power as you think you do. Watch you don\u2019t strain yourself."}, {"text": "You may believe in yourself 100 per cent but it seems not everyone shares the idea that you are someone special. Expect some challenges today, especially from those who feel threatened by your rather obvious desire to move up in the world."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to be so subdued but you can tell from what is going on around you that this is not the time to call attention to yourself. Keep a low profile over the next 24 hours and don\u2019t get drawn into other people\u2019s fights and feuds."}, {"text": "You may seem a bit timid at times but when it\u2019s necessary to get tough you go all the way, and that may well be the situation you find yourself in today. Makes sure anyone who tries to cheat you, in small ways or large, regrets it."}, {"text": "You may not be able to trust what other people tell you today but you can trust your own instincts, so calm your mind and let your inner voice speak to you. It knows all the answers, even though you probably don\u2019t know half the questions!"}, {"text": "By all means let others know what you think about a shared situation but don\u2019t expect them to agree with you. Today\u2019s Mars-Jupiter link suggests that some people will take an opposing view merely to spite you. That\u2019s okay \u2013 speak your mind anyway."}, {"text": "An offer of some kind will intrigue you but can you trust the people who are making it? The planets warn they may not be telling you the whole story, and until you are in possession of all the relevant facts it might be best to keep your distance."}, {"text": "Jupiter in your sign gives you a positive outlook on life, but you need to be aware that some of the people you are dealing with may not be entirely on your side. Be realistic about what you can do together, which probably isn\u2019t much at all."}, {"text": "The way a friend or loved one or work colleague goes on and on about a matter that seems utterly trivial to you may be annoying but you need to take their concerns seriously. Not everyone possesses your grasp of the bigger picture Aquarius."}, {"text": "The more others complain that you don\u2019t listen to their advice the more you should follow your own instincts. Your recent run of good fortune is down entirely to trusting what your inner voice has been telling you, and there\u2019s no reason to stop trusting it now."}, {"text": "Your light will shine brightly over the coming 12 months, so much so that others will be attracted to you like moths to a flame. You\u2019re used to being the centre of attention but this could verge on adulation. Don\u2019t let it go to your head!"}, {"text": "Take time out from your busy schedule to chat with friends and family members. According to the planets you have been so occupied with work-related matters of late that some people are starting to feel a bit neglected. Don\u2019t let a bit become a lot."}, {"text": "For some strange reason you seem to doubt that you have what it takes to succeed. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 what happens over the next few days will see your attitude go through a 180-degree turn and you\u2019ll start to believe that your future is bright."}, {"text": "You will find yourself up against some powerful people over the next few days, people who will try to assert their authority over you. They will only succeed if you show that you are intimidated, so be strong and act as if you don\u2019t scare easily."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you feel a bit unsure of yourself as the new week begins as it\u2019s a quite natural reaction to the overconfidence you showed a week or two ago. You need to find a workable midpoint between rampant self-belief and irrational doubt."}, {"text": "You continue to show enthusiasm for something that is unlikely to bring you much in the way of material reward, and that\u2019s good. Maybe at last you have realized that it\u2019s not all about money and status, that there are more important ways to measure success."}, {"text": "You will discover something that helps you turn the tables on those who have been giving you a hard time in recent weeks. By all means get your own back but don\u2019t make a big thing of it \u2013 vendettas lead to tears for everyone and are best avoided."}, {"text": "If someone who has a grudge against you makes claims that you are not doing enough on the work front or that you are shirking responsibility in other ways you cannot just ignore it. Your reputation is at stake, so make sure everyone knows they are telling lies."}, {"text": "Whatever it is you have been planning these past few weeks you must get cracking on it now. Within a matter of days you will get the chance to impress people in positions of authority, so have something ready to show them that highlights your talents."}, {"text": "If you get carried away by your own importance today you must expect trouble, as a rival who would like nothing better than to cut you down to size will go out of their way to make you look bad. Keep your ego under guard at all times."}, {"text": "If you stay calm and tackle one job at a time today, you will get through everything that needs to be done \u2013 and still have time for fun and games. It\u2019s when you try to do everything at once that mistakes, and hence delays, are most likely to happen."}, {"text": "No one is putting any pressure on you, so why are you putting so much pressure on yourself? If you feel you have something to prove to the world then you need to get past it. If anything Aquarius the world should be proving itself to you!"}, {"text": "The more others criticize what you are doing the more you will carry on doing it. Just be careful that your rivals are not playing a game in which they get you to do one thing by making it seem as if they are pushing you to do another."}, {"text": "The more you tell yourself there is nothing you cannot accomplish the more likely it is you will achieve something good, even great, over the coming 12 months. You\u2019re a Leo. You\u2019re larger than life and you\u2019re a winner \u2013 so go ahead and win big"}, {"text": "If there is someone you wish to impress then go all out today to show them why you are the one they need to work with. However, you must make sure you can deliver on any promises you make. If you let them down your reputation will suffer."}, {"text": "Try not to let minor worries become major anxieties. The message of the stars for you now Taurus is that no matter how negative certain situations may look they will, in the fullness of time, have positive consequences \u2013 so keep your troubles in perspective."}, {"text": "Avoid looking for complicated solutions to what are really quite simple problems. As a general rule of thumb the most obvious explanation is likely to be the right explanation, so stick to the basics and always keep an eye on the bigger picture."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t lack for good intentions but are they effective? According to the planets, you are finding it hard to match what you want to do with what you can actually accomplish at the moment. Could that be because you are expecting too much of yourself?"}, {"text": "The sun in your sign makes all things possible, but those things won\u2019t just happen by magic \u2013 the effort must come from you. Also, a positive attitude is a must over the next few days \u2013 it won\u2019t guarantee success but it will make it more likely."}, {"text": "Listen to your inner voice today and do what it tells you, even if it seems counter to what the more logical side of your brain says you ought to be doing. Try not to overthink situations that should be allowed to develop without conscious control."}, {"text": "Spend the first half of today getting your work under control, then spend the second half of the day having fun with your friends and family members. All work and no play makes a Libran dull \u2013 and dull is the one thing you were not born to be!"}, {"text": "Question everything you hear today, even if it comes from a source that you trust 100 per cent. It\u2019s unlikely they are trying to deliberately trick you but it\u2019s quite possible they themselves have been tricked into believing something that isn\u2019t true."}, {"text": "The more you can find out about the motivations of someone you work or do business with the less likely it is you will misjudge them and put your relationship at risk. Just because they act in confusing ways does not mean they are being devious."}, {"text": "Do you take it easy today, or do you push yourself as hard as you can in an effort to get on top of your workload? Only you can decide but if you make an extra effort now your time is more likely to be your own tomorrow."}, {"text": "Focus on building relationships today and don\u2019t let professional or financial considerations dictate your actions. You\u2019re a people person by nature, so you should understand that long-term success depends quite heavily on how you get along with those around you."}, {"text": "Some tasks need to be tackled immediately, while others can be put off to a later date. The trick is working out which is which, so spend some time looking at the facts and considering what options are open to you. Then and only then make your decision."}, {"text": "A sun-Jupiter link on your birthday makes all things possible, so decide what it is you want most from life then resolve to go out and make it your own. You are an irresistible force Leo, and there is no sign of any immovable objects up ahead."}, {"text": "No matter what disappointments you may have encountered in recent weeks it\u2019s now all systems go and nothing can stop you from having fun. The world is a fantastic place \u2013 if you look at it with the right sort of eyes \u2013 so enjoy it to the full."}, {"text": "Steer clear of making judgments, especially when dealing with people whose outlook on life is different to your own. It may be that you cannot see why they think and act as they do but have you considered they might see you in exactly the same way?"}, {"text": "Friends and loved ones will go out of their way to be nice to you today and you must be nice to them in return. Jupiter in your opposite sign makes it easy for you to recognize the good in people \u2013 it\u2019s always there if you look for it."}, {"text": "Jupiter\u2019s influence in the work and well-being area of your chart means you may be tempted to push yourself harder today, but is that such a good idea? You may be strong enough to deal with extra responsibilities now but what about later when your energy fades?"}, {"text": "This is one of the very best days of the year for you and if you make an effort to express yourself \u2013 professionally, creatively, romantically, or in any way you please \u2013 you are sure to make a huge and positive impression. Aim to be amazing, Leo."}, {"text": "Let fate take its course and don\u2019t try to change things that cannot or should not be changed. Also, while the sun is moving through the most secretive area of your chart it may not be a good idea to call attention to yourself. You have things to hide!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you are not in the mood to travel today because other people will come to you. You may think you want to be left alone but once you start chatting with friends you won\u2019t want to stop \u2013 and together you\u2019ll put the world to rights."}, {"text": "You may want more of the good things in life but don\u2019t get so caught up in the quest for material things that you forget what truly matters. You are already rich in terms of love and friendship, and as such are better off than most people will ever be."}, {"text": "Whatever changes take place in your life over the next 24 hours you can be sure that in the long term they will work in your favor. With Jupiter in your sign linked to the sun your prospects look bright, and will be brighter still if you remember to smile!"}, {"text": "The planets warn you are chasing too many goals and too many dreams. What you need to do now is find a quiet place where you can be on your own, away from worldly influences, and decide what your priorities are going to be. Then stick to them!"}, {"text": "This should be a wonderful time for you and will be more wonderful still if you make an effort to reach out to people you meet on your travels. You may be surprised just how many of those people share your dreams. Why not pursue them together?"}, {"text": "Jupiter\u2019s influence in the area of your chart that governs your social and professional standing means that any efforts you make today and tomorrow will improve your reputation in major ways. Show employers and other important people that you mean business."}, {"text": "A sun-Saturn link on your birthday will bring all sorts of challenges but the good news is you have what it takes to conquer them all. A new romantic interest is also likely over the coming 12 months \u2013 or maybe an existing love will reach new heights of passion."}, {"text": "If there is something you want today you will find a way to get it, even if it means barging other people out of your path. Just remember that what goes around comes around again eventually, so think of the future and try not to be quite so aggressive."}, {"text": "You will have no option today but to do what family members and work colleagues want you to do. They are very much in the driving seat at the moment and have no intention of moving over for you. You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride."}, {"text": "It would appear that you are very much in control at the moment and that other people will pretty much do what you ask of them. Don\u2019t let it go to your head though. Just because you have the power does not mean you have to use it."}, {"text": "You will get the chance to show what you can do today, and the fact is you can do lot. As a Cardinal sign you know what you want and you have every intention of getting it and, no matter what your rivals may do, you will succeed."}, {"text": "There will be no half measures for you over the next 24 hours \u2013 anyone who is foolish enough to stand between you and whatever it is you desire won\u2019t be standing for long. Hopefully most people will be sensible enough to stay out of your way."}, {"text": "The planets warn you are trying to please too many people and do too many things at the same time and the results are unlikely to be satisfactory. Cut back on your aims and focus on quality rather than quantity, both at home and at work."}, {"text": "You may need to flex your muscles and remind certain individuals that you are not about to give up on something you believe in. Just because you\u2019re a nice guy by nature does not mean you don\u2019t know how to fight for your rights \u2013 and you will."}, {"text": "You will find out something worth knowing about a colleague or employer today and you can, if you wish, use it to further your own interests. Over the long term, though, that may not be such a good idea, especially if it results in them holding a grudge."}, {"text": "What other people think about what you believe is of no importance \u2013 the only thing that matters is that you believe it with all your heart. The more others criticize you over the next few days the more sure you can be that you are on the right track."}, {"text": "Saturn in your sign is urging you to change something in your life that you no longer enjoy. But you need to be sensible about it. Don\u2019t just throw everything that no longer seems to fit out in one mad rush. Change your world a step at a time."}, {"text": "Do what you feel is right today and if other people don\u2019t like it, well, that\u2019s too bad. Creatively you have a lot going for you at the moment, so don\u2019t be afraid to move in a more radical direction. You may be surprised where you end up."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to let someone get away with comments about you that are clearly untrue, but if you do it guarantees they will be repeated further down the line. Stand up for yourself and forcefully correct those who try to undermine your reputation."}, {"text": "You will enjoy considerable financial and professional success over the coming year but you need to remember that there are more important things than getting on in the world. Love the person you are with for who they are, not for what they can do for you."}, {"text": "Think long and hard before starting something new today or over the weekend. And if you do decide to go ahead with it make sure you plan well ahead. The more time you spend on preparation the less time you will have to spend fixing mistakes."}, {"text": "By all means work hard and play hard today but don\u2019t push yourself to such a ridiculous extent that you risk damaging your health. You may have a spring in your step but that does not mean that every stride you take must be a giant one."}, {"text": "The most important thing today is that you spell out in plain and simple language what it is you want. Sometimes you appear to believe that friends and loved ones can read your mind, but no matter how well they know you it will never be true."}, {"text": "You cannot decide whether to admit that you made a mistake of some kind or to brazen it out and hope that nobody notices. Choose the former approach. Others will respond in a more lenient fashion if you admit up front that you got it wrong."}, {"text": "If someone offers you a financial or business opportunity of some kind today don\u2019t think that you have to take it. It may mean more money and prestige but will it mean more enjoyment of life? If you\u2019re not certain then give it a miss."}, {"text": "This is a good time for making plans, especially if you are working on something creative. The more obstacles you meet over the next 24 hours the more you will be inspired to find ways around them. Challenges always bring out the best in you."}, {"text": "Some surprising things are likely to occur over the next few days but chances are they will be pleasant surprises. A lot, of course, depends on your attitude to change. If you can embrace new ways of doing things then life will be so much more enjoyable."}, {"text": "Sometimes the best way to change things for the better is not to get personally involved in social issues but to do what you know to be right regardless of what other people might think about it. Have the courage to follow your conscience today."}, {"text": "There is no point getting annoyed with someone just because you don\u2019t agree with what they say. The fact is they have every right to express their opinions \u2013 just as you do \u2013 and if you think they are wrong then just explain why clearly and calmly."}, {"text": "Saturn in your sign urges you not to lose touch with reality. Whatever else you do over the next few days you must remember to follow the facts at all times and to base your decisions on hard evidence rather than wishful thinking."}, {"text": "There is no point getting worked up about something that is going to happen whether you like it or not. Put it out of your mind completely and focus on what you enjoy and what you have some level of control over. Why make life difficult for yourself?"}, {"text": "If you are looking for ways to revive a relationship of some sort then what happens today and over the weekend will give you no end of good ideas. But don\u2019t just do what pleases you most \u2013 do what is likely to please the one you love."}, {"text": "A project you begin over the next few months will take off in a big way before the end of the year. You will hit on something a lot of people are going to want and there will be no limits to how far you can take it \u2013 so go all the way."}, {"text": "You need to knuckle down to some serious work this weekend, but that does not necessarily mean physical work. As mind planet Mercury moves back into the most creative area of your chart you should be looking for ways to express your latent genius."}, {"text": "You will need to focus on family issues of one sort or another over the next 48 hours. A solid and happy domestic foundation is the rock on which you can build success of both a professional and financial nature in the near future."}, {"text": "Mercury, your ruling planet, moves in your favour again this weekend, so keep your options open and be ready to react to new opportunities, of which there will be plenty. Travel and social plans that were recently disrupted can now start moving ahead again."}, {"text": "You need to make sure that the things you have changed in recent weeks stay changed, and what happens over the next 48 hours will help you test whether they are as strong as you think they are. Make sure what you build is going to last."}, {"text": "Mercury moves back into your sign this weekend, making it easier for you to express yourself and to persuade other people that their interests and your interests are closely allied. Above all Leo, recognize that you don\u2019t have to do everything yourself."}, {"text": "You are about to embark on a period of self-examination and what you discover about yourself over the next few days could be a touch uncomfortable. The good news is that once you face up to the issues that arise you will be mentally stronger for it."}, {"text": "This is an important time for your ideas and beliefs and it\u2019s quite likely that some of the things you have taken for granted in the past won\u2019t seem so clear cut in the future. That\u2019s good. Life isn\u2019t about standing still, it\u2019s about growing and progressing."}, {"text": "Your need to speak up and let people in positions of authority know who you are and what you can do. As Mercury, planet of communication, joins the sun in the career area of chart this weekend you will find exciting new ways to express yourself."}, {"text": "Not everyone will approve of what you choose to do this weekend, but you\u2019re in one of those typically Sagittarian moods where you simply don\u2019t care what the rest of the world thinks \u2013 and it means you\u2019ll get a lot done in a short space of time."}, {"text": "Be realistic about what you can hope to achieve. Aim high by all means but make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for and how much of an effort you are going to have to make. At the very least, be kind to yourself."}, {"text": "Even if you make it clear to those around you that you are not in the least bit interested in their opinions they will still make sure you hear what they have to say. At least pretend to listen, even if you have no intention of following their advice."}, {"text": "Changes in your work or career could be unsettling over the coming months but in the long-term they will work in your favour, so embrace them and find ways to turn them to your advantage. Above all you need to accept that nothing stays the same forever."}, {"text": "Think carefully before you decide to end a partnership of some kind. It may seem the right thing to do on an emotional level but will it be in your long-term interests? It may not be a perfect relationship but it still has it uses."}, {"text": "The pace of life has been extreme of late but as changes planet Uranus begins one of its retrograde phases you may get a bit of a breather. Don\u2019t take it too easy though as you still have important issues to resolve, and important people to impress."}, {"text": "There is no point working on something which no longer interests you, so end it now and move on to something more interesting. Don\u2019t feel guilty about leaving other people behind \u2013 the only thing that matters is that your work makes you happy."}, {"text": "Certain people will be rather assertive today, maybe even aggressive, so reduce the chances of conflict by not saying anything that could annoy them. However, if they do, make it clear they want a showdown then you may have to come out fighting."}, {"text": "Someone you want to impress may be a touch critical of your performance today and although it will hurt your pride to admit it you know they have a point. Don\u2019t get defensive about it \u2013 learn from what they tell you and resolve to do better next time."}, {"text": "You\u2019ll want to do something different today but whatever it is you must not let it disrupt your existing routine. Can you have it both ways? You can if you think ahead and get others to assist you rather than trying to do it all on your own."}, {"text": "No matter how successful you may be there is something more you want to achieve and if you start moving toward a new goal today it won\u2019t be long before you reach it. Changes are good for you Libra, so long as you know what it is you desire."}, {"text": "You may have to raise your voice a bit to get heard today, but try not to get angry if some people don\u2019t seem to be paying attention. If they miss out on what you have to say then that\u2019s their loss, one they will much regret later on."}, {"text": "It is important that you put principle ahead of power today, even if it means that you lose out in some way. Nothing is more important to you than your reputation for honesty, so don\u2019t risk it for the sake of short-term benefit. It\u2019s not worth it."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, make a few waves and embarrass someone who annoys you but be warned, it could also cost you in ways you cannot foresee. Yes, of course, life should be fun but it\u2019s rarely a good idea to make fun of other people."}, {"text": "Your ambitions need to be narrowed down to just the two or three things that mean the most to you. You have far too many things going on in your life at the moment and that means your energy tends to be scattered, thus losing power."}, {"text": "Listen to and act on what your inner voice tells you this year. Friends and family members may give you all sorts of advice but the only person you can really trust is yourself and deep down you always know what is true and what is right."}, {"text": "You will have to give up on something today and whatever it happens to be you are advised to let it go quickly and without regret or a backward glance. The sooner you get rid of it the sooner you can move on to something much, much better."}, {"text": "A relationship will be put to the test today and although it should survive it won\u2019t be the same again. That might sound negative but in fact the opposite is true: having a clearer understanding of each other\u2019s needs will move the relationship to a more mature level."}, {"text": "Your workload will increase a bit over the next few days but that\u2019s okay. In fact you may be pleased that you are being forced to do more as you have not been your usual dynamic self of late. A bit of external discipline will do you good."}, {"text": "You need to get serious about something of a creative or artistic nature. If you want it to be a success \u2013 and of course you do \u2013 then you are going to have to move up to a higher level and show friends and colleagues that you mean business."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t find it easy to express yourself today but you don\u2019t have to. Friends and relatives know you well enough to interpret what you are trying to say, even if the words come out a bit garbled. Body language is important too, and you\u2019ve got plenty of that."}, {"text": "At some point today you will realize that an opinion you have carried for many years is maybe not the last word on the subject. Don\u2019t feel bad if you find you have to adjust your outlook on the world \u2013 many people, unlike you, are incapable of change."}, {"text": "A change you made in the distant past will begin to make itself felt over the next few days. If you had given up on it making much of a difference it will come as a pleasant surprise to find that your efforts were not in vain after all."}, {"text": "You may not have accomplished as much as you had hoped over the past few months but you have still done more than most people, so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Remember, it\u2019s not the quantity of your experiences that matters but the quality."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t give up on something just because you are finding it tough. The planets indicate you are now close to the point where your efforts pay off and it starts to come easy to you. You\u2019re more than halfway there, so there\u2019s no point in turning back."}, {"text": "Major changes are taking place but you\u2019re not the sort to let it worry you. On the contrary, you find it amusing that so many people are losing their heads and running around as if it\u2019s the end of days. If only everyone could be like you!"}, {"text": "You must protect your interests today, because if you don\u2019t you could find that a rival takes advantage of your weakness and takes possession of something that used to be yours. Better to make an enemy or two than let yourself be bullied."}, {"text": "If you can believe in yourself and what you are doing then the next 12 months will see you taking giant strides toward fulfilling your ambitions. You have the talent and the knowledge and the energy to change your life for the better, so start using it more."}, {"text": "You can accomplish a lot on your own today but you will accomplish so much more if you get together with a group of friends or like-minded workmates. Creatively, artistically and professionally the more you do with others the more success you will enjoy."}, {"text": "If you try to negotiate from a position of weakness there is no way you will get a good deal and the sooner you recognize that fact the sooner you can start making the necessary changes. If your position is still weak, try allying yourself with powerful people."}, {"text": "If there is something you need to do but don\u2019t know how to go about it then you must get help from the experts. It will, of course, cost money but you could end up paying twice as much if you try to muddle through on your own."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that what you do in public makes it seem as if you are making a difference. You like to believe that you are a good person, even though the world around you can at times be wicked, so do something positive today."}, {"text": "You may think you know what is going to happen next but the planets warn you are most likely fooling yourself. You may be acting in a rational manner but the problem is that some of the people you are dealing with will be acting on emotion alone."}, {"text": "You want to forgive someone who has hurt you but they are not making it easy. Perhaps it\u2019s time to accept that there is something in their nature that compels them to say and do things that are not very nice. On this occasion, forgiveness is overrated."}, {"text": "Make use of other people\u2019s knowledge and life experience to get what it is you desire. Libra is a sign that knows how to deal with people on a one-to-one level and there is no reason why you should not be using that skill to further your professional aims."}, {"text": "Whatever you are currently working on you are advised either to finish it quickly or to put it on the back burner for a while. Your solar chart indicates that tomorrow\u2019s full moon will bring a demanding new challenge that requires your full attention."}, {"text": "You will get through a great deal of work with very little effort today, if you can be bothered. But if you can\u2019t be bothered, don\u2019t worry about it. There is no law that says you have to put work before play, so by all means just relax."}, {"text": "If something about a work or business deal does not feel quite right then play for time and find out what is wrong about it. Most likely you will discover that the other party is withholding information that you need to know to make a proper decision."}, {"text": "It will pay you to do whatever it takes to stay on good terms with work colleagues, even though some of the things they say and do may annoy you intensely. You will most likely need their assistance tomorrow, so keep it nice and friendly today."}, {"text": "A full moon on your birthday will challenge you in ways that demand a response, so don\u2019t think you can keep a low profile over the coming 12 months. Why would you want to anyway when there is so much going on in the world that excites you?"}, {"text": "Someone you meet on your travels will have a big effect on your opinions and the way you look at the world. They may be no one special in themselves but what they tell you will be special \u2013 so special in fact that it might even transform your existence."}, {"text": "You must not allow your passions to get the better of you over the next day or two. As the full moon cuts across the family and career axis of your chart you may be tempted to favour one over the other but both must be given equal prominence."}, {"text": "You have strong opinions about certain topics and you are not going to change them for anyone but try occasionally to understand why some people see the world through different eyes. It will make life easier and might even benefit you financially."}, {"text": "It\u2019s okay to be a bit concerned about your financial situation but it\u2019s not okay to let it dominate your thinking every minute of the day. Take care of family and relationship issues first and let the dollars and cents take care of themselves."}, {"text": "A relationship that has been going through changes will go through one more change today and it could be the one that truly matters. Can you find a middle way where you both agree to differ? If you can then your time together is sure to continue."}, {"text": "You must face up to reality. There can be no more wishful thinking about what is happening in your life. Today\u2019s full moon will encourage you to sweep away all those things you have persuaded yourself are true but which you know deep down are not."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s cosmic activity, the full moon in particular, will bring about some rather startling events. Creatively and romantically this is a time when you can change many things for the better, but to do so you need to pull with partners, not push against them."}, {"text": "Someone you have feelings for will say or do something today that not only takes you by surprise but makes you wonder if they have the same kind of feelings as you. Chances are they do but the full moon is distorting your perceptions. Let it pass."}, {"text": "Things won\u2019t happen the way you expect them to today but that\u2019s okay because whatever occurs it will work in your favour one way or another. A relationship that has been going through a tough time of late will actually deepen and become more passionate."}, {"text": "As always you will get what you want over the next few days but for best results you need to make sure that partners and family members and friends get what they want too. For every winner there can be and should be another winner."}, {"text": "Be careful what you ask for today because the full moon in your sign could bring it to you in a way that you did not expect and probably won\u2019t be too happy about. Why not ask for nothing and make more of what you already have?"}, {"text": "Will this be a good year or will it be a great one? That\u2019s the only question worth asking now because the planets indicate the year ahead has so much potential that there\u2019s no limit to what you can accomplish. Aim high, then go higher still."}, {"text": "The time has come to clear the air by bringing into the open feelings that have been festering too long. Don\u2019t hold back. If what you have to say turns others against you then so be it. You were not put on Earth to worry about sensitive souls."}, {"text": "You may think you are behaving in a rational manner, but others fear you are allowing your emotions to get the better of you. If even quite minor criticism sets you off today they may have a point \u2013 you don\u2019t usually react like this."}, {"text": "If you find that your heart isn\u2019t in what you agreed with others needed to be done then by all means find a way out of it. You won\u2019t exactly be flavour of the month but better you act now than later on when there is more at stake."}, {"text": "Just because you helped someone out in the recent past does not mean you should help them out now. The fact is they are in their current spot of bother because they made exactly the same mistake as they made last time. This time, let them sort it out."}, {"text": "Those around you seem a bit excitable at the moment, so do what you can to calm them down and resist the temptation to say or do things that get them even more worked up. It might be amusing to you but it\u2019s not very friendly, is it?"}, {"text": "Something that should be simple is causing you all sorts of problems and you can\u2019t understand why it seems to be you alone who doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d. Don\u2019t worry. With Mercury, your ruler, under pressure today your brain is just moving a little slower than usual."}, {"text": "If someone tries to deflect attention away from their own failures by blaming you for minor errors you must not put up with it. Make sure they know that you have no intention of putting up with that kind of behaviour. Hit back at them \u2013 hard!"}, {"text": "You need to act fast if you are going to impress someone who may be able to assist you in your career. The fact is they are rather busy at the moment, so time your approach well and make sure they get the message that you\u2019re worth the effort."}, {"text": "Be careful you don\u2019t overreact to criticism and make things difficult for yourself as a result. Even if what others say really annoys you this is not the time to make an issue of it. Pretend it doesn\u2019t bother you \u2013 and start plotting your revenge for later on."}, {"text": "If you make an effort to see things from someone else\u2019s point of view today it will go a long way toward defusing a situation that could so easily spiral out of control. You may not care for their worldview but you can still accept it."}, {"text": "You need to stand your ground and refuse to move even an inch today. It does not matter who is right and who is wrong, it matters only that you are entitled to your opinions and are under no obligation to change them, not now, not ever."}, {"text": "You can sense that some sort of crossroads is looming and know that very soon you will need to decide whether to go straight ahead or whether to move to the left or the right. The one thing you cannot do this year is go back the way you came."}, {"text": "If you make an effort to help other people this weekend the universe will reward you in ways you won\u2019t see coming. Also, on the work front try not to push yourself quite so hard. You\u2019ve done your bit, now let other people do their share."}, {"text": "TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):"}, {"text": "As Mars moves into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend you will find that your energy levels go through the roof. Make sure you set yourself realistic goals though \u2013 no matter how much energy you have the impossible still won\u2019t get done."}, {"text": "Activities on the home front will be hugely enjoyable over the next 48 hours and for once you won\u2019t mind partners and loved ones and relatives hitting on you to do things for them. Be generous with both your time and your energy."}, {"text": "The cosmic picture begins to shift away from money matters and toward having fun this weekend, so start thinking about what you want to be doing and make sure your friends are included in your plans. Don\u2019t be so much of a loner."}, {"text": "Now that Mars is moving into the area of your chart that governs what you own and what you earn you will find that matters of a financial nature will be on your mind a lot more than usual. Just remember it\u2019s not all about dollars and cents."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t follow the herd Virgo, do your own thing. In recent weeks there have been times when it seemed as if the whole world was against you but somehow you survived and now you will thrive. Trust your own instincts and go it alone."}, {"text": "What happens over the next 48 hours may be unsettling and may even plant a seed of doubt in your mind, but there is actually very little to worry about. Try spending a bit less time socializing and a bit more time exploring your own thoughts."}, {"text": "You will deal with a crisis of some sort with the minimum of fuss this weekend \u2013 if there is one thing Scorpio does well it is staying calm in times of trouble. Avoid petty issues and petty people though \u2013 you have more important things to deal with."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try to do everything in one mad rush over the next 48 hours. That applies doubly on the work front, where the planets warn that a rival is hoping you will slip up and make him or her look good at your expense. Don\u2019t let it happen."}, {"text": "You will enjoy yourself if you are on the move this weekend. If you are in a position to take a short vacation then don\u2019t hesitate \u2013 it is sure to be eventful in the best possible way. If you have to stay close to home at least start making plans."}, {"text": "You will need to find a balance between your work and your social life over the coming 12 months. By all means go out and have as much fun as you can handle but don\u2019t forget you have commitments too. There will always be those who depend on you."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t know for certain how to get a job done until you make a start and see where it takes you. Fortunately, you are the sort of person who enjoys a challenge, so roll up your sleeves and get stuck in \u2013 not tomorrow or next week, but now!"}, {"text": "It may at times feels as if the world is against you but it isn\u2019t true and as the cosmic picture shifts in your favour this week your outlook on life will change for the better. Believe you have what it takes to succeed \u2013 and you surely will."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not that you made a mistake that matters so much as you tried to pretend, both to yourself and to other people, that you did not. Everyone gets it wrong sometimes \u2013 yes, even a Gemini \u2013 so own your error and then put it right."}, {"text": "If a partnership seems a bit too restrictive then maybe you should end it. That may seem ruthless but deep down you know the time has come for a radical adjustment in your personal life, one that puts you at the centre of things rather than other people."}, {"text": "If you feel that you are in some way out of your depth then ask for assistance. The real problem, of course, is that you don\u2019t like others to know that you cannot handle everything yourself \u2013 you think it shows weakness. No Leo, it doesn\u2019t, so get help."}, {"text": "Your interest in a project you appeared to give up on a while back will be rekindled over the next few days and this time you should have the self-belief, and the know-how, to make a success of it. It\u2019s all about timing Virgo \u2013 so do it now!"}, {"text": "Your self-belief may take a dive over the next few days as the planets start to emphasize the area of your chart that governs your fears and your feelings. Don\u2019t try to avoid the difficult questions your mind starts asking \u2013 embrace them and seek out the answers."}, {"text": "Your freedom to come and go as you please has been hampered of late but over the next few days the bonds that have held you back will start to loosen a bit. Just don\u2019t go mad and start acting as if there are no restraints at all."}, {"text": "Try not to let annoying people get under your skin as the new week begins. Keep telling yourself that your success depends entirely on you and that you can safely ignore the critics and cynics. Their negativity means they fear you could succeed."}, {"text": "Whatever happens over the next few days, be it good, bad or indifferent, you must continue to believe that in the long-term everything will work out right. The way you choose to look at the world to a large extent determines what kind of world you see."}, {"text": "You of all people should know that nothing stays the same forever, nor should you want it to. Your revolutionary spirit has not been much in evidence of late and over the next few days you need to rediscover what you used to be so passionate about."}, {"text": "They say that what does not destroy you makes you stronger and over the coming weeks you will get to see if that is true. Whatever trials and tribulations you face you must remember that they will be less of a trial if you face them with friends."}, {"text": "You may prefer to trust what people tell you rather than be doubtful or cynical but your birthday chart warns you must check facts and figures for yourself. Hopefully your honesty will be matched by their honesty but you can\u2019t take that for granted."}, {"text": "Try not to dwell on minor problems to such an extent that you build them up in your mind to major levels. In the greater scheme of things everything is progressing exactly as it should, so stop worrying and start smiling. Find reasons to be happy."}, {"text": "It seems you have been so busy pointing out the mistakes other people have made that you somehow overlooked the fact that you\u2019ve made a few of your own. Look in the mirror today and be honest about what you see. Then start making changes."}, {"text": "There is no need to rush things today, not even if there is a task that needs to be done as quickly as possible. Quality is always more important than quantity and you will somehow find the time you need to make a good job of it."}, {"text": "Life is too short to waste time worrying about who is for you and who is against you, so put that kind of nonsense out of your head and follow your heart wherever it leads you. Act with confidence and in time even your critics will love you."}, {"text": "Someone you thought was a friend will try to take advantage of your generous nature either today or tomorrow and you won\u2019t be too pleased about it. But don\u2019t get angry. In fact, if you can, give them what it is they desire. Rise above pettiness."}, {"text": "Yes, you have a way with words, but before you open your mouth today you should think long and hard about what you are going to say. How you say it will be important, too. If you must be critical add a dash of praise as well."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to push yourself extra hard today \u2013 especially if you have a deadline to meet \u2013 but the planets warn that might not be a good idea. Start the week at a leisurely pace and build up speed as you go along. Deadlines can wait."}, {"text": "It may seem as if everyone but you has been having fun of late, but don\u2019t worry about it. By the time the sun moves in your favour again on Thursday you will be the one with a smile on your face and the wind in your hair!"}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that you will encounter fierce opposition to what you intend to do today but don\u2019t let that stop you. Keep your eye on the prize and keep moving relentlessly forward. Don\u2019t stop for anyone, not even those you love."}, {"text": "This should be a good week for you socially but there is a danger you could spend far too much money on luxury items and have to cut back on essentials later on. There are ways to have fun without breaking the bank \u2013 well, your bank at least."}, {"text": "Your powers of persuasion are high at the moment, so if there are things that you need don\u2019t hesitate to let others know about it. Nothing comes for free, of course, but if you ask nicely there is a very good chance you will get a sizeable discount."}, {"text": "Try not to let your excitement for a new plan or project show today, because you need time to get it off the ground properly before other people start getting involved. You will get more done over the next 24 hours if you mainly work alone."}, {"text": "You may be hugely ambitious, and that\u2019s good, but you also need to recognize that you won\u2019t always be able to get your own way. Try being a bit more laidback about your career goals this year. There are so many other ways you can enjoy yourself."}, {"text": "If someone tries to take liberties with you today you must not let them get away with it. Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your standing in the world demands that you talk and act tough. Your reputation depends on it."}, {"text": "If you lock horns with someone who turns out to be bigger or better connected than you today it may pay you to back off a bit and let them know it\u2019s really no big deal. The planets warn you need to choose your battles carefully."}, {"text": "If you react to some kind of provocation today, you could quickly find yourself at a disadvantage. Don\u2019t play into your rivals\u2019 hands by getting worked up about issues that, in the greater scheme of things, are really quite trivial in nature."}, {"text": "A clash of wills may be inevitable today as Mars links with the sun in a less than helpful way. Be patient with people who annoy you by saying one thing and then doing another. They want you to get angry, it\u2019s part of their plan."}, {"text": "Be prepared for a certain amount of stress today, especially on the work front where some of your colleagues are clearly not up to whatever tasks you are working on together. But don\u2019t do it all yourself. They need to improve their game."}, {"text": "This is a good day for getting things done but you must not make promises you won\u2019t be able to keep. It is no doubt flattering that others believe you can work wonders but don\u2019t forget you have limits like everyone else. You\u2019re human Virgo!"}, {"text": "If you let your anger get the better of you today it could be you who suffers the most as a result. As one of those pleasant, balanced Libra types people expect you to stay calm and won\u2019t be impressed if you lose your head."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t just sit back and let things happen \u2013 get out into the world and make them happen. The sun leaves the career area of your chart on Thursday, so use the next 48 hours to push ahead on the work front. It\u2019s impossible to be too ambitious."}, {"text": "If someone questions your ambition and desire today you will of course do everything in your power to show you are still on track for success. Just be careful you don\u2019t overdo it and damage yourself physically. You\u2019re flesh and blood like everyone else."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign makes it easy for you to open up and let the world know what you think but others influences warn if you say too much it could cost you financially. Never let potential rivals know what your tactics are likely to be."}, {"text": "You may have a soft spot for someone but it seems you are the only one. Don\u2019t be surprised if friends and family try to pressure you to cut ties with them today \u2013 for your own good, of course. It\u2019s your call to make and it won\u2019t be easy."}, {"text": "You may be surprised by what happens today, and delighted. No matter how many times you have fallen out with certain people of late they will now rally round and help you hit whatever target it is you are aiming for. They\u2019re still on your side."}, {"text": "You need to define what you want most from life. For too long you have been drifting without an obvious goal and it is beginning to get you down. What is your highest ideal? How can you change the world for the better? Answer those questions, then act."}, {"text": "Spread your workload around as much as you can today. If you try to do it all on your own you will exhaust yourself and actually fall further behind. Get partners and colleagues to do some of the heavy stuff for you \u2013 it\u2019s what they\u2019re there for!"}, {"text": "The more you push yourself now the more you will benefit over the next month or so. You have been grappling with some serious issues of late and it\u2019s not always been easy for you, but as from tomorrow a pattern will begin to emerge."}, {"text": "Partners and loved ones may be difficult to get along with today but you must not let it get to you. They can approach life with a negative attitude if they so wish but you have no intention of doing likewise. The world is still a wonderful place."}, {"text": "It\u2019s time to get serious about a relationship that until now you have approached in a lighthearted manner. It can still be fun, of course, but you need to start asking yourself what you can do to make your time together more productive."}, {"text": "If you have been wasteful with money in recent weeks you will soon have to look for ways to balance the books. The planets warn you are getting near the point where what comes in may not be able to cover what goes out. Start making savings!"}, {"text": "You know what you want and you know how to get it, so all you have to do now is get on with it. Right? It won\u2019t, of course, be quite that simple but once the sun moves into your birth sign tomorrow you can start making serious progress."}, {"text": "You may think that your life is tough but if you take a look around you will realize that compared to most people you\u2019ve got it quite easy. Stop feeling hard done by and find ways to help yourself \u2013 and in doing so help others too."}, {"text": "A friend or work colleague will give you some excellent advice today but because it isn\u2019t what you want to hear you may ignore it. That\u2019s fine, of course, but don\u2019t go running to them for sympathy if it goes wrong. You won\u2019t get it!"}, {"text": "You will be put to the test over the next few days, especially on the work front where you will be expected to take on more responsibility, whether you want it or not. Throw yourself into the situation and don\u2019t doubt for a moment that you will succeed."}, {"text": "Everyone makes mistakes \u2013 yes, even a Capricorn \u2013 so don\u2019t beat yourself up about something that recently went wrong. If you expect perfection of yourself you are sure to be disappointed. Aim for mere excellence instead \u2013 you know you can do that!"}, {"text": "If something you value is taken from you today don\u2019t rant and rage about it. Find out why it happened and, most importantly, what you can do differently next time to stop it happening again. Turn a short-term loss into a long-term gain."}, {"text": "If you fall out with someone at home or at work you must \u2013 repeat, must \u2013 make up with them quickly, if possible by the end of the day. The sun\u2019s move into the relationship area of your chart tomorrow means you cannot afford to let feuds fester."}, {"text": "There will be times this year when you wonder if the world has finally gone crazy. Maybe it has but that does not mean you have to act in foolish or fanatical ways as well. Stay calm on the inside and don\u2019t let the outside world affect you."}, {"text": "The sun in Leo over the past few weeks has done wonders for your confidence (not that it needed much of a boost) but now you must slow things down a bit and pay more attention to the specifics of what you are working on. Details matter."}, {"text": "The sun moves into the sympathetic sign of Virgo today, marking the start of what should be one of those most creative and productive times of the year. Put any failures and disappointments you might have suffered behind you. The future is bright."}, {"text": "Now that the focus of your solar chart is moving toward feelings and affections you need to open up and let others know what is going on in your heart. Don\u2019t keep family members at arm\u2019s length any more, let them get as close as they like."}, {"text": "No matter how busy you may be at the moment you must make time for social activities of one sort or another. The more of an effort you make to mix with people from all walks of life the more your own life will benefit. It\u2019s all good."}, {"text": "Try to be a bit more selective about how you use your time and energy. In recent weeks, while the sun was moving through your sign, you did so many things on the spur of the moment, but now you need more structure to your activities."}, {"text": "As the sun moves into your sign today you will start to feel on a deep inner level that the world is full of opportunities. Nothing is beyond you. Nothing is out of reach. Aim as high as you can, then aim a little higher each and every day."}, {"text": "Make time today to look back over the past four weeks or so and evaluate what you have learned both about yourself and other people. Most likely you will come to the conclusion that friendships are the key to what makes the world go round."}, {"text": "You have never been one to follow the accepted way of doing things and you have no intention of changing your ways now. If others want to play by the book today that\u2019s fine, let them get on with it. It makes it easier for you to be different."}, {"text": "Even if you are the sort of Sag who could not care less about climbing the ladder of material success you can still be ambitious in other ways. What happens over the next few days will inspire you to make your mark on the world. Go for it!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in one of the more positive areas of your chart will bring the adventurous side of your nature to the fore today. Don\u2019t hesitate to strike out in a completely new direction \u2013 you could end up in the land of your dreams!"}, {"text": "Before making changes to a business arrangement of some kind make sure you get expert advice from a trusted source. There could be a lot more than money at stake, so make sure you don\u2019t make any silly and avoidable mistakes."}, {"text": "You will be confronted by a situation that forces you to compromise. You may not be happy about it but the fact is you are up against forces that are too strong to oppose. You can still strike a good deal but it may not be the deal you envisioned."}, {"text": "The only way you are going to create the amazing life you dream of is by getting rid of all the emotional and mental baggage that is holding you back. A brave new future is yours for the asking \u2013 IF you can let go of the past."}, {"text": "Someone will point out where you have been going wrong today and you probably won\u2019t be too happy about it. Be that as it may you would be wise to listen to what they have to tell you. Don\u2019t let your ego override common sense."}, {"text": "Forget about pleasing other people and do what seems best for you. The approaching full moon is likely to bring a certain amount of opposition from people who appear to believe you exist solely to benefit them. It\u2019s time you put them right!"}, {"text": "Your judgment could be a bit off today, so if you are thinking of making changes of one sort or another it might be wise to wait a while. Everything that is meant to happen will happen in its own good time, so don\u2019t push too hard."}, {"text": "A situation that you find funny may be no laughing matter to friends and work colleagues, so be careful what you say and do. It might be a good idea to at least pretend you share their serious outlook, even if you want to laugh out loud."}, {"text": "There will be times over the next few days when you come dangerously close to panic but there is actually precious going on in your life that you need to be worried about. Slow down, calm down and stay in control. You\u2019re jumping at shadows!"}, {"text": "The sun in your sign gives you no end of confidence but as the moon is nearing its full phase, it\u2019s quite likely that a relationship issue will come to a head and in some way upset you. Don\u2019t lose your grip Virgo \u2013 it\u2019s really no big deal."}, {"text": "Promise yourself now, this very moment, that whatever happens today and over the weekend you won\u2019t overreact. So long as you stay calm and refuse to get caught up in the general feeling of hysteria there is precious little that can hurt you."}, {"text": "No matter what happens over the next 24 hours, friends and family will rally round and help you feel good about life. Not that you should be feeling bad at all, as compared to most people your fortunes are clearly on the up. So smile! "}, {"text": "The approaching full moon cuts across the home/work axis of your chart, which suggests you need to find a better balance between the two. It\u2019s good to be a success, of course, but ultimately it\u2019s still love that makes the world go round."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not often you let down your hair and act as if you just don\u2019t care but now the sun is moving through the most adventurous area of your chart you may well go over the top. You can worry about the consequences later \u2013 or not!"}, {"text": "Your cash-flow situation could be better but it could also be worse, so stop worrying that the sky is about to fall and enjoy what the day has to offer. Always live in the present moment, because you can\u2019t change the past or control the future."}, {"text": "The approaching full moon will make it abundantly clear that you need to make some pretty big changes in your life. A plan or project you once had high hopes for is no longer worth the time or the effort. Ditch it and move on to something better."}, {"text": "Both Saturn and Uranus are strong on your birthday this year, which suggests you are now at a major crossroads. What you do is less important than how you choose to do it, so identify your goal, then go after it with all your body and soul."}, {"text": "Anything of a professional nature should go well for you now, but it will go even better if you let go of old-fashioned ideas and methods and try something new. Show those who doubt you that you have what it takes to be a serious player."}, {"text": "Something that has been worrying you for ages will no longer get under your skin as from today. No doubt you will be a bit concerned that you allowed your fears to get out of hand but you overcame them eventually. Better late than never."}, {"text": "You may think you are above petty jealousies and squabbles, but the planets warn you could easily get involved in a feud that on most other occasions you would avoid like the plague. Strive to keep your more extreme emotions under control."}, {"text": "Lady Luck is smiling on you now and you have every right to make the most of it. Don\u2019t listen to those who say you don\u2019t deserve your good fortune because they have no idea what they are talking about. On the contrary, no one deserves it more."}, {"text": "The most important thing this weekend is that you make sure at all times that it is your aims you are working toward and not other people\u2019s. That does not mean you should not help them when you can but you must help yourself first."}, {"text": "Yes, it would appear that someone is being deliberately obstructive at the moment but that does not mean they should be thought of as an enemy. It seems they honestly believe they are slowing you down for your own good. Maybe they\u2019re right!"}, {"text": "If you deal in anything but rock solid facts today you could be setting yourself up for a serious fall. Steer clear of gossip and rumour and don\u2019t think you need to exaggerate to make yourself look big. You\u2019re already as big as you need to be."}, {"text": "Spell out in words of three syllables or less what it is you expect of other people. If you fail to do that there will be no end of confusion and no end to accusations that you deliberately made your message hard to understand."}, {"text": "You seem strangely reluctant to give orders at the moment. Why is that? Maybe it is because you don\u2019t want to be responsible for other people\u2019s failures. But how could they fail if they have been instructed by you? Get on with it."}, {"text": "Either you will go too far or you will fail to get started at all today. You are in one of those moods where only the extremes seem attractive, so make more of an effort to follow a middle path. Above all, control what you say and do."}, {"text": "Even if you are the sort of Aquarius who prefers to keep a low profile, the current cosmic climate won\u2019t allow you to stay in the shadows. In some way or other, today\u2019s sun-Uranus link will inspire you to put on a show. Make it spectacular!"}, {"text": "This is a good time to ask for a favour from a friend or family member but bear in mind you won\u2019t get it for free. At some stage they will expect you to do something equally as helpful and valuable for them. It\u2019s a fair swap, so do it."}, {"text": "A Venus-Uranus link on your birthday suggests that something dramatic is going to happen in your love life this year. Not everything that occurs will make sense but, strangely, the things that make the least sense will be the things that are the most fun!"}, {"text": "Tell a friend or work colleague how much you appreciate their advice and assistance today. As an Aries you know how to lead and inspire all sorts of people but it\u2019s still a good idea never to take anyone\u2019s support for granted."}, {"text": "You are in no mood to do as you are told and anyone who thinks they can issue orders to you will have to learn the hard way that your bite can be as bad as your bark. Some of the language you use will leave them reeling!"}, {"text": "The planets warn that unless you truly have no choice in the matter you should not be starting anything new. Conserve your physical and emotional energy over the next week or so because you are going to need it all later in the year."}, {"text": "Someone you meet on your travels may be a lot of fun but be on your guard because the planets warn they may be out to deceive you. You don\u2019t have to erect a barrier between you but you do have to keep personal details to yourself."}, {"text": "People come to you with their problems because they know you are a very good fixer, but unless you want your life to be taken up listening to sob stories you have to make it clear that enough is enough. Maybe find a convenient place to hide."}, {"text": "Push problems on the work front to one side today and focus on having fun. Whatever those problems may be they will most likely resolve themselves around the time of Friday\u2019s new moon. The less you fret the more of a success you will be."}, {"text": "Life may not be a bundle of fun at the moment as cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart makes everything seem a bit gray, but don\u2019t despair. Better times are coming and soon the picture of your life will be multicoloured again."}, {"text": "By all means go out and enjoy yourself as the new week begins, but be careful how much money you spend and be even more careful who you choose to spend it on. Some of your so-called friends would be better described as freeloaders."}, {"text": "Time spent planning is rarely time wasted, so don\u2019t worry that you seem to be thinking more than doing at the moment because the time to take action will be here soon enough. Later on you\u2019ll have more fun than you know how to handle."}, {"text": "Look for compromise solutions in everything you do and make sure you ask friends and work colleagues for their opinions every step of the way. The planets warn if you try to push ahead without support your vision is unlikely to see the light of day."}, {"text": "No matter how settled and secure you feel at the moment there are some major changes on the way, so don\u2019t get too comfortable. The good news is these changes will benefit you in ways that you cannot foresee, so welcome them rather than try to avoid them."}, {"text": "You must not let anyone, not even your family and your closest friends, talk you down over the next few days. Yes, the way the planets are aligned you will most likely be taking orders rather than giving them, but you are a free spirit too."}, {"text": "With energy planet Mars so strong on your birthday you must set yourself challenges for the coming year that really test your limits. You may be surprised, and delighted, to find that you are capable of much more than you imagined. Be amazing Virgo!"}, {"text": "Mars, your ruler, ends its retrograde phase today, making this the perfect time to start pushing ahead on the work front. Make sure employers and other important people know who you are and what you can do. And try to be more of a team player!"}, {"text": "No one has the right to tell you that you must believe certain things and disbelieve others.

Your viewpoint is as valid as anyone else\u2019s."}, {"text": "If you have been a bit wasteful with money of late you will get the chance to get back some of what you lost. Sacrifices will have to be made but in the long-term they will be worth it. And next time, try not to squander your resources."}, {"text": "If you have fallen out with a friend or family member, this is the time to approach them and try to get things back to how they were before. Don\u2019t blame yourself for what happened but don\u2019t blame them either. Differences of opinion will always occur."}, {"text": "You need to lighten up a bit and stop worrying about things that most likely will never happen. As Mars moves in your favour in the well-being area of your chart today you must not overdo it physically \u2013 or mentally or emotionally come to that."}, {"text": "Something that previously seemed difficult if not impossible to get your head around will now be easy to understand. The situation itself has not changed in the slightest but your mind has \u2013 it has expanded to a level where much more makes sense."}, {"text": "Family problems should be less intense as from today and if you recently fell out with a loved this is the ideal time to kiss and make up. Don\u2019t worry that you or they or both of you got a bit emotional \u2013 it no longer matters."}, {"text": "The time has come to open up and let others know what issues have been on your mind these past few weeks. The planets indicate that you no longer have to keep your thoughts to yourself or your ideas under wraps. Let it all come flooding out."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have been deceiving yourself about the true state of your finances and need to do something about it pretty quickly. That should be easy now that Mars is moving in your favour again, but it may also be painful."}, {"text": "Mentally, emotionally, and maybe physically too, you have been carrying more weight than you can comfortably handle but as from today it will feel as if the burden has been lifted from your shoulders. Next time, try not to take on so much."}, {"text": "You have been worrying far too much of late and need to adjust your mind so that it focuses on the good things in life rather than the bad. Think of what is to come and how you can shape the future in a way that pleases you."}, {"text": "If a project is still not going the way you want it to go then maybe you should take it as a sign that you need to get help. There are plenty of people who would love to assist you, but they won\u2019t do so unless you ask."}, {"text": "Mercury, your ruler, links with luck planet Jupiter on your birthday, but because the angle between these planets is challenging, you need to be on your guard. Use your imagination by all means but don\u2019t let flights of fancy tempt you to take foolish risks."}, {"text": "Focus on what you are good at and forget about trying to impress other people. The more certain individuals encourage you to take risks the more likely it is they are hoping you will make a fool of yourself. You don\u2019t have to make it easy for them."}, {"text": "So many people need your assistance but the simple fact is you can\u2019t help them all, so focus on the most deserving cases and give them 100 per cent. If you truly want to be a force for good you may need to be ruthless too."}, {"text": "Pace yourself carefully today and resist the temptation to take on more tasks than you can comfortably handle. With Mercury, your ruler, at odds with Jupiter, planet of excess, there is a danger you could go too far and fall off the edge!"}, {"text": "Common sense is not as common as some people imagine and the planets warn you need to think carefully before you act. If you take risks that are not called for it could cost you dearly later in the week, not only financially but emotionally, too."}, {"text": "Put recent upsets and upheavals behind you and focus on more important matters. According to the planets a partner or loved one feels a bit left out of things at the moment and you need to reassure them they are still very much in your thoughts."}, {"text": "Stop kidding yourself that you are happy with your lot and start making changes that can make your life more enjoyable and fulfilling. The sun in your sign will help you get on in the world, so socialize more and get yourself noticed."}, {"text": "Some people may say you are being too pushy but don\u2019t listen to them. What they actually mean is they are not comfortable with the fact that you refuse to do what they want you to do. And why should you? They don\u2019t own you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste precious time and energy on a new project when there is an existing one that needs to be completed.

Do it now Scorpio!"}, {"text": "What you lack in experience you more than make up for in enthusiasm and over the course of the next few days you will impress a lot of people with your can-do attitude. Important people are watching you closely \u2013 make sure they like what they see."}, {"text": "If someone tries to convince you to invest in a scheme you don\u2019t know much about you are strongly advised to give it a miss. With mind planet Mercury under the influence of Jupiter there is a real danger you are not thinking straight!"}, {"text": "You have been pushing yourself extremely hard of late and will reach a point over the next 24 hours where you find it impossible to keep going at your current speed. Slow down before you break down \u2013 there is no glory in making yourself ill."}, {"text": "The line between fact and fiction may be a bit blurred at the moment, especially where relationship issues are concerned, so don\u2019t be too eager to support one person over another.

Nothing wrong with that, so long as your head always gets the final word."}, {"text": "The more your rivals criticize you today the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. There is no reason at all why you should change your routines or methods \u2013 on the contrary, keep doing what you are doing, only more so!"}, {"text": "There may be disagreement with a colleague about the best way to proceed over the next 24 hours but don\u2019t take it too seriously because you are still basically on the same page. Everyone seems a bit touchy at the moment, so make allowances."}, {"text": "Compromise solutions seem hard to come by of late but while you are right not to back down from your position you could try to see things from opposing viewpoints once in a while. Failing that, avoid people who rub you the wrong way."}, {"text": "You cannot stand by while some sort of injustice is occurring. Do what you can to remedy the situation but don\u2019t take it all on your own shoulders. You may be in the right but it helps if you have might on your side too. You need powerful allies."}, {"text": "The changes you make today, at home as well as at work, won\u2019t easily be changed back later, so think before you act and if there is any doubt at all maybe refrain from making changes at all. There\u2019s a lot to be said for inaction!"}, {"text": "The sun in your sign adds a dash of fearlessness to your nature but you would be wise not to take on people who are bigger and better connected than you. Do you really need to make a big issue out of a minor disagreement? Probably not."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart urges you to steer clear of people and events that depress you. What you need most at the moment is to be part of an environment that is cheerful and uplifting. Where might you find it?"}, {"text": "You must \u2013 repeat, must \u2013 stand up for yourself and make sure everyone knows you are not going to be their dogsbody or doormat. You don\u2019t have to be a tough guy about it but you do have to show you can bite as well as bark."}, {"text": "If you find yourself up against forces that are clearly way out of your league then you must back off.

Don\u2019t be fooled by their lies \u2013and don\u2019t let others be fooled either."}, {"text": "If someone tries to stand in your way today just shove them aside and continue with your journey. You don\u2019t have time for fools and still less time for those who think it\u2019s fun to cause avoidable problems, so get tough and get the job done."}, {"text": "Your task for the coming year is to live in the moment and not give too much thought as to how your dreams are going to come true. The universe will both guide and protect you, so there is no need to make plans or promises."}, {"text": "An offer you think cannot be refused MUST be refused, at least in the short-term. The planets warn that if you take it at face value you run the risk of giving far more than you get, so tone down your excitement and maybe think again."}, {"text": "Somewhere along the line you made a promise that you would like to get out of but friends and family are demanding that you live up to it. And so you must. If you go back on your word the damage to your reputation will be immense."}, {"text": "If you reveal too much about your plans today you are sure to regret it.

How you view the world is how your world will be."}, {"text": "It may at times be annoying that not everyone sees things the same way as you but if they did life would be hugely boring, which is far worse. Enjoy the different people you meet and the different opinions they hold, today and every day."}, {"text": "Mercury\u2019s link to your ruler Pluto suggests you are now in a position to impress some very important people, but you must not exaggerate what you can do. Just be yourself and let them take you or reject you as you are. They\u2019ll take you!"}, {"text": "You have a tendency to put off making decisions until the last possible moment and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. Today\u2019s cosmic alignment suggests most strongly that if you hesitate you could lose out big time, so act now!"}, {"text": "You need to let certain people know that you will never allow them to have any kind of hold over you. You don\u2019t have to be nasty about it but you do have to spell out in plain language that you are your own boss \u2013 and mean it!"}, {"text": "If you feel like doing something out of the ordinary today by all means go right ahead, but don\u2019t make it so outrageous that you leave yourself open to criticism \u2013 or worse! The last thing you need is to give your enemies a weapon to hurt you with."}, {"text": "You need to take care today that your sentiments about a certain issue are not so obvious that it encourages others to play on your feelings for their own benefit. Try to disguise your sensitivities so they don\u2019t make you such an easy target."}, {"text": "Virgo is the sign of schedules and details and small print and if you remember that fact and play to your strengths you won\u2019t go far wrong over the coming 12 months. Leave grand plans and the \u201cvision thing\u201d to other people. Keep life simple."}, {"text": "Assess your priorities and devote your time and your energy only to those things that you consider to be worthy goals. There are only 24 hours in a day, even for an Aries, and you cannot possibly get everything done at once. Think quality, not quantity."}, {"text": "The sun in the sympathetic sign of Virgo at this time of year means there is no limit to what you can accomplish. Career-wise, as well as creatively and romantically, just about everything you turn your hand and mind to will go amazingly well."}, {"text": "Loved ones may be rather demanding but if you put yourself out for them now they will do just about anything for you later on. You may not agree with all their aims and ambitions but don\u2019t let that deter you. Humour them and help them."}, {"text": "What you do with your life is limited only by the boundaries you choose to impose on yourself, so start believing that all things are possible and before you know it, you will be heading for the top. As a cardinal sign it\u2019s where you belong."}, {"text": "The sun in the financial area of your chart makes this a good time to look at what you own and what you earn and how you can improve your cash-flow situation. Worldly things are important to you now, so by all means aim to be rich."}, {"text": "Most things you tackle now will work out well. This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, so don\u2019t hold back \u2013 go all out to be a winner in the game of life. And do so with a smile on your face."}, {"text": "You might prefer to disguise your feelings and pretend that nothing fazes you but the sun in the most sensitive area of your chart means you won\u2019t fool anyone but yourself. There is nothing wrong with showing your emotional side Libra."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste precious time dreaming about what might have been if you had only done this or done that. You should know by now that the only day that truly matters is today, so aim to make each 24-hour period better than the one before."}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to keep your opinions to yourself and you are not about to change your ways now. Having said that, you need to recognize that if you say the wrong thing to people in positions of power it could rebound badly on you."}, {"text": "If you feel like packing a travel bag and heading off into the unknown then by all means do so. At this time of year more than most you need to get away from your usual environment, if only for a few hours. Give your wanderlust its head."}, {"text": "It may be that for every step forward you take the universe shoves you two steps back but don\u2019t be disheartened. If nothing else this particular phase in your life will teach you how to be patient, something that does not always come naturally to you."}, {"text": "You may look at life in terms of black and white, good and evil, right and wrong, but deep down you now it isn\u2019t like that at all. It\u2019s time to admit, if only to yourself, that the world is a far more complicated, and more interesting, place."}, {"text": "Life will have its ups and downs over the coming year but on balance you will end up in a higher, brighter place then where you are at the moment. If you truly want to be happy and fulfilled try to focus more on matters of the heart."}, {"text": "You may have your suspicions about the motives of some of the people you currently do business with but try not to let it show. If they get the impression that you no longer trust them they may decide to take their business elsewhere."}, {"text": "It appears you have the Midas touch. Okay, so not everything you come into contact with will turn to gold this weekend but both in your personal life and at work you can do no wrong. Make the most of it \u2013 you know it\u2019s unlikely to last."}, {"text": "Keep reminding yourself how fortunate you are. It may at times seem as if life itself is conspiring against you but it isn\u2019t true \u2013 in fact the universe wants you to be happy and successful. Your mind creates your world, so dream up something amazing."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that almost anything you ask for over the course of the weekend will be yours in a matter of days. You can, if you wish, focus on material things but for best results spend time with your family \u2013 love is the greatest prize."}, {"text": "Everything that is meant to happen will happen, not a moment too early and not a moment too late. It may seem silly to believe that your life is unfolding according to some sort of cosmic design but it is \u2013 and it\u2019s a design that is wholly benign."}, {"text": "Your open and outgoing attitude will draw people to you over the next 48 hours and there may be times when you wish you were a little less popular. Be that as it may you are in demand for a reason \u2013 because your friendship is of infinite value."}, {"text": "If you have made a mistake of some kind now is the time to own up to it. Others will readily forgive you and even if there is money at stake they won\u2019t hold you personally responsible for their loss. Next time though, think before you act."}, {"text": "The more you confide in friends and relatives this weekend the more likely it is they will be in a position to help you. You don\u2019t have to let them in on all your secrets, of course, but trust them enough to know one or two."}, {"text": "Try not to push yourself too hard this weekend. You won\u2019t lose out, financially or personally, by sitting back and taking it easy for a while. Let the world come to you for a change \u2013 better still, let it pass you by completely."}, {"text": "Even if you are the kind of Capricorn who always seems calm and quiet you will make some noise over the next few days. Why the sudden change in attitude? Because some things are worth shouting about even if you don\u2019t like to raise your voice."}, {"text": "Put career issues on hold over the next 48 hours and focus on your family. Yes, of course, you still have so much work to get through but do you really have to do it right now, this very minute? Probably not. Loved ones are more important."}, {"text": "If a friend or family member is feeling low this weekend you must make it your business to cheer them up. A few words from you could be just what they need to raise their spirits and get them going again. You have the healing touch."}, {"text": "By all means put everything into reaching your life\u2019s dream this year but don\u2019t forget that other people have a claim on your time too. Make sure those you love know what it is you are aiming for \u2013 and find ways they can help you to succeed."}, {"text": "Make sure it is you who is in control of your emotions today and not your emotions that are in control of you. If you let your more negative feelings get the better of you there could be less than enjoyable repercussions a little further down the line."}, {"text": "Try not to be too aggressive today. With the sun linked to energy planet Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart you may think you can do as you please but there will be comebacks if you go too far. Remember, life isn\u2019t a war."}, {"text": "If a family member makes you an offer of some kind today you would be wise to consider it seriously, even though your first reaction may be that it is too risky. Maybe it is, but since when did you start favouring the easy path through life?"}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Mars link urges you to speak up and let the world know what it is you most desire. You may prefer to keep your passions to yourself but your instincts tell you that, on this occasion, secrecy is not the smartest option."}, {"text": "A money-making opportunity could land in your lap over the next few days and the planets suggest if you get it right you could make a sizeable profit. Remember though that you\u2019re not the only one after this prize, so think and act fast."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Mars link in your birth sign means it is time to start something fresh. Get out into the world and make yourself known to people whose friendship might be of use to you career-wise. A little networking now could pay big dividends later on."}, {"text": "After a series of recent highs it\u2019s inevitable that you will experience some sort of reaction but that\u2019s okay. If you feel disconnected from the celebrations going on around you today it\u2019s nothing to be concerned about \u2013 you just need some time on your own."}, {"text": "No matter how many times you have promised yourself that this week, month or year will be the one when you make your mark you must not lose heart. The omens are good for a big breakthrough this week, so be ready to act when your chance comes."}, {"text": "Your big task now is to get your act together on the work front. You can be a bit too laidback at times and if you let current opportunities pass you by you may look back later on and wish you had been more dynamic. Go for it Sag!"}, {"text": "If you have an urge to travel then start making serious plans, because there will be opportunities aplenty to spread your wings over the next few weeks. Give your mind permission to roam as well. What\u2019s in your head today will be in your life tomorrow."}, {"text": "You will begin to notice over the next few days that the world is full of opportunities you were previously unaware of. Someone with your huge talents should be out there making a name for themselves, so get busy. You have a destiny to fulfil."}, {"text": "Partners and colleagues will help you out if they can but how can they assist you if they don\u2019t know what it is you need? Speak up today and make sure everyone around you knows what they can do to get you through your current difficulties."}, {"text": "A Venus-Mercury link on your birthday means that your powers of persuasion will be high over the coming 12 months. Both at home and at work you should be able to find just the right words to get others to work with you rather than against you."}, {"text": "No matter what you may have planned for the rest of the year, the rules of the game will change over the next few days, so try to keep your options open. The less you commit yourself to now the more room for manoeuvre you will have later on."}, {"text": "What occurs over the next three or four days will remind you that you should never take anything for granted. You should know by now that it is just when you are most satisfied with your lot that the earth shifts beneath your feet!"}, {"text": "You will get the chance to make your dreams come true over the next few days but it will cost you in various ways and not just financial. You may even have to make a choice between your principles and material gain. What will you decide?"}, {"text": "You need to come to a final decision about a partnership matter that has been causing you no end of problems. Deep down you know you need to cut the knot but you can\u2019t work out how best to go about it. You\u2019ll find a way today."}, {"text": "A work or health issue has been annoying you for quite some time but when Saturn moves in your favour again later in the week you will get the chance to deal with it once and for all. Be ruthless with yourself but lenient with other people."}, {"text": "You are allowed to be less than perfect. Too often of late you have been unnecessarily hard on yourself because, in your own mind at least, you failed to reach a certain level of success. Time to remind yourself that you are human like everyone else."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have been taking too much for granted, especially in one-to-one relationships and maybe even at home, and what happens over the next few days will remind you that you should always be on your guard."}, {"text": "What occurs today or tomorrow will force you to think again about something you have always taken for granted. It\u2019s okay to have strong opinions about the big issues in life but sometimes you need to be able to change your outlook. Can you do that?"}, {"text": "A solution to your cash-flow problem is about to reveal itself but it may not be entirely pleasant. Saturn, planet of restriction, warns you may have to make some major cuts in your spending, some of which will go deeper than mere luxuries."}, {"text": "You may not be in the mood to make compromises at the moment but when Saturn, your ruler, ends its retrograde phase on Thursday you will no longer have any say in the matter. Do what is required of you and do it with a smile on your face."}, {"text": "Why are you running away from your problems? You should be running straight at them. As is so often the case what scares you the most right now will most likely turn out to be something you can quite easily handle. Face up to your fears."}, {"text": "A friendship has been going through a tough time of late but before this week is over you will be back on good terms again. Don\u2019t bother trying to work out why you fell out, just agree to get past it and start doing good things together again."}, {"text": "For quite some time you have been torn between two very different ambitions in life and your birthday stars indicate you need to find a compromise course. It does not have to be one or the other, it can be both. Get creative about it."}, {"text": "You must not assume that because you recently came through a difficult phase unscathed you will be able to do the same thing as easily in the future. The planets warn that too much optimism could be a bad thing over the next few days."}, {"text": "Like it or not it\u2019s time to get tough with someone who has been abusing your generous nature. It\u2019s okay to feel sorry for this person but it\u2019s not okay to allow them to take, take and take again without giving anything back in return."}, {"text": "Take good care of your health over the next few days because the influence of Jupiter, planet of excess, warns you cannot go on burning the candle at both ends without serious consequences. Everyone has their limits \u2013 yes, even a Gemini!"}, {"text": "There are things going on behind the scenes, both in your personal life and at work, that will answer so many of the questions you have been asking of late. Be patient a little longer and soon you will understand what has been going on, and why."}, {"text": "You may think you are a law unto yourself but you are about to receive a rather big reminder that it isn\u2019t true. Even a Leo must toe the line in certain situations, so be smart and do what the powers that be expect of you, for now."}, {"text": "You may think that you can make a better job of something than other people, and maybe you can, but the simple fact is you have not been asked, nor will you be. Focus on what is directly in front of you today and ignore everything else."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t seem to have a care in the world at the moment and that\u2019s great, but don\u2019t relax to such an extent that events you should be able to control start getting away from you over the next few days. Have fun but stay sharp too."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to lose touch with reality but the planets warn you seem to believe that nothing can possibly go wrong with your life at the moment, and that\u2019s asking for trouble! Keep your feet on the ground and keep your eyes and ears open."}, {"text": "You will have to deal with some pretty big challenges over the next few weeks but you are up to the task and will come through with flying colours. Just remember you don\u2019t have to do it all on your own. Get help if you need it."}, {"text": "According to the planets a rival has set some kind of trap for you but you will see it with ease and take whatever evasive action you think is necessary. Don\u2019t bother trying to hit back at them. Why would you want to stoop to their low level?"}, {"text": "It seems like every time you want to do something the people you want to do it with say they want to do something else. Maybe you should take the hint and accept they have plans of their own. Go off and do your own thing instead."}, {"text": "Life has been moving at such a hectic pace of late that you probably feel drained. In which case you need to slow things down and give your mind and body the break they so obviously crave. Let the world know you\u2019re taking time off."}, {"text": "You will go all out to prove yourself to the powers that be over the coming year, but be careful you don\u2019t overdo it and end up physically and mentally exhausted. Know your limits and be smart enough to stay within them. You can still be a star."}, {"text": "You have begun to realize that you are putting far more into a partnership than you are getting out and it cannot go on that way. You may have to get tough over the next 24 hours \u2013 sadly it\u2019s the only language some people appear to understand."}, {"text": "Someone you meet while on the move will influence your aims and ambitions and maybe even change the direction your life is to take. Once they have opened your mind to new possibilities you will understand how limited your horizons have been."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s Mars-Mercury link will encourage you to be more assertive, which is good, but there is also a danger that you will go too far and get aggressive for no good reason. Be confident by all means but don\u2019t say things you may later regret."}, {"text": "You may be unaware of the fact but someone you work or do business with resents your popularity and success. For that reason alone you would be wise to question what others tell you today. Don\u2019t make it easy for them to make you look bad."}, {"text": "If you offer someone an inch don\u2019t be surprised if they take a mile. Some people cannot resist being greedy, especially when they think no one will stand up to them. You\u2019re hardly \u201cno one\u201d though, you\u2019re a Leo, so don\u2019t offer them anything at all!"}, {"text": "You are not short of energy and enthusiasm at the moment but today\u2019s cosmic picture warns you may be short of common sense, so think before you act and, if there are any doubts in your mind, maybe don\u2019t act at all. What\u2019s the rush?"}, {"text": "Anyone who is unable to think and act as quickly as you do will be in for a rough ride today. You have no time, and no inclination, to carry passengers. Push yourself hard but push friends, family and work colleagues hard as well."}, {"text": "If someone says something damaging about you today you must, of course, hit back and let everyone know it isn\u2019t true. Beyond that you need to find out why they thought it necessary to make an enemy of you. It\u2019s hardly a smart move."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, use scare tactics to get people to do things for you today but it would be a lot simpler, and more efficient, to use your considerable charm. Why risk making enemies when you can just as easily make friends and allies?"}, {"text": "Mars in your sign makes you hugely assertive and with communications planet Mercury coming into the picture as well you must watch what you say over the next 24 hours. Keep your tongue in check or it could get you into lots of trouble."}, {"text": "It may feel as if you are losing control of events but how can you lose control of them when they were never yours to direct in the first place? Stop worrying and start enjoying life again. If you\u2019re not smiling then you\u2019re not doing it right!"}, {"text": "You may be enthusiastic about a new plan or project but don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that enthusiasm alone will be enough to see it through to completion. Work with people who share your ambitions. There\u2019s strength in numbers."}, {"text": "Saturn, planet of restriction but also success, is strong on your birthday, which means you must expect some heavy responsibilities to come your way this year. Don\u2019t try to avoid them \u2013 if you embrace them willingly they could be the making of you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let people who have no right to know what you are up to quiz you about your private affairs. The planets warn that any personal information you let slip may be used against you by your rivals later on, so keep your lips zipped!"}, {"text": "Mind planet Mercury moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today, so any doubts that have been plaguing you will disappear as if they never existed. Believe in yourself and believe that you were put on Earth to make a difference."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart will make it easy for you to say the right things and smooth over any cracks that may have formed in family relationships. Spend time with your loved ones and give them your undivided attention."}, {"text": "You have become a touch too predictable of late, so what can you do to remind friends and colleagues that you should not be taken for granted? Whatever strategy you decide on make sure you don\u2019t go too far \u2013 avoid extremes at all costs!"}, {"text": "This is a good time to start thinking of ways to make some extra cash. With Mercury, planet of the mind, moving into the financial area of your chart today you won\u2019t be short of money-making ideas. You\u2019ll also know how to spend it!"}, {"text": "Something that seemed vague or muddled will come into sharp focus today as Mercury moves into your sign. Not only will you understand what has been going on but you will know in an instant how best to take advantage of it. Go for it Virgo!"}, {"text": "The moment you resolve one crisis another seems to pop up to take its place. Is the universe having fun at your expense? Maybe it is but there is no need to worry. What looks like \u201cbad\u201d news now will look extremely good later on."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to put up with situations that are not to your liking. Don\u2019t be afraid to let others know that you have your doubts and don\u2019t hesitate to question the accepted wisdom. Some so-called \u201cexperts\u201d may turn out to be nothing of the kind."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to keep a low profile and you have no intention of changing your ways now. On the work front especially you will let everyone know who you are and what you can do \u2013 and, more importantly, what they can do for you."}, {"text": "If you need a break this is the time to give it some serious thought. Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs faraway places will encourage you to think global rather than local. Before you know it you could be on your way!"}, {"text": "Sometimes you just want to be left alone with your thoughts and as mind planet Mercury moves into one of the more secretive areas of your chart today that won\u2019t be a problem. No one will bother you if you don\u2019t bother them."}, {"text": "You need to let partners and loved ones know what you are thinking. It\u2019s not enough to expect them to read your face or take clues from your actions, you must spell out for them in plain and simple language what\u2019s going on in your head."}, {"text": "Partnerships are under good stars on your birthday, as are creative activities. If you can find ways to combine the two you may be able to break through to higher artistic and scientific levels. Where you are is not enough \u2013 aim to go higher still."}, {"text": "At last you are willing to admit that something you have been working on is not worth the effort. It may be disappointing but you have also learned some valuable lessons \u2013 not least that you should listen to your instincts before you listen to other people."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you have to put a project of some sort on hold today, because you can always come back to it later. You have so much on the go at the moment that you have no choice but to focus on the most important things first."}, {"text": "You may not trust what a colleague is telling you but it seems you have no option but to act on what they say. Yes, there is a possibility that you are being lied to but the planets indicate it won\u2019t be your loss. The universe has your back."}, {"text": "You may not be in the most outgoing of moods at the moment but that\u2019s okay. As a Cancer you need to hide away once in a while to replenish your energy and revive your interest in life. You\u2019ll bounce back bigger and better than ever."}, {"text": "The best way to deal with people who insist on making a drama out of the most mundane of things is to ignore them and take whatever action is needed yourself. They are unlikely to thank you for it, of course, but everyone else will."}, {"text": "If there is something you have wanted to do for years but for one reason or another never quite got around to then get your act together and get started on it immediately. You can and you will make a huge success of it \u2013 IF you start now!"}, {"text": "Start looking for ways to turn the tables on people who have given you a hard time. You don\u2019t have to be blatant about it \u2013 as a Libra you can do subtle \u2013 but you do have to let everyone see that you will NOT be taken for a fool."}, {"text": "If you insist on taking an opposing view to whatever the accepted wisdom happens to be you must expect to be attacked for it. Will that bother you? Of course not! The fact that you are attracting criticism means, in your mind, that you are in the right."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart is piling up a great deal of pressure, but you won\u2019t let it get to you. Anyone who thinks you are going to roll over and play dead obviously knows nothing about who and what you really are."}, {"text": "Someone you work alongside may say something about you that is less than flattering. Don\u2019t go off on your own and sulk about it \u2013 confront them directly and ask how they have come to that opinion of you. It could be a case of mistaken identity!"}, {"text": "Yes, this may be a frustrating time for you, but it won\u2019t last much longer, so keep smiling and keep reminding yourself that behind those big black clouds the sun is still shining brightly. Always imagine you can feel its warmth on your cheek."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to let a rival off the hook this weekend but is that really such a good idea? If you give them the impression that you are too soft-hearted they won\u2019t hesitate to take you for a ride again and again. Stand up for yourself \u2013 and mean it."}, {"text": "Venus and Mars, the relationship planets, dominate your birthday chart, which means you would be wise to take other people\u2019s feelings and opinions into account before taking action of any kind. What you do with others is what you will do best."}, {"text": "This would be a good time to make peace with someone you recently fell out with. You may genuinely feel that they were mainly at fault but don\u2019t let that stop you from making the first approach. Life\u2019s too short to hold petty grudges."}, {"text": "Your creative powers are at a peak right now, so make good use of them. The sun in Virgo encourages you to take the kind of chances you usually try to avoid, so be brave and be ready to move in a new direction at a moment\u2019s notice."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of love and harmony, moves into the work and well-being area of your chart this weekend, which means you will do best if you take life as it comes. Why try to force the pace and risk exhausting yourself for no good reason?"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart means you will find it easy to reach the targets you have set yourself. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you should lower your sights \u2013 on the contrary you should be aiming higher than ever before."}, {"text": "Sometimes you get so caught up in the daily struggle for existence that you forget how loved you are by family and friends. Pull your mind away from \u201cserious\u201d things for a while and focus on what truly matters \u2013 your home and your family."}, {"text": "If the pressures of life are beginning to get too much for you just cut loose for a while and have some fun. There is only so much you can accomplish at any one time, so give yourself a break and rejoin the fray much refreshed later on."}, {"text": "If you find yourself losing interest in what you are working on you should take it as a sign that it\u2019s not the right thing for you. In the past it may have been about how much money you could earn, but now you need something more intellectually fulfilling."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be afraid to open up and show the world your vulnerable side. There is no point pretending you are as tough as old boots when, deep down, you are as lost and bewildered as everyone else. You\u2019re only human Scorpio. Don\u2019t laugh, it\u2019s true!"}, {"text": "If you are feeling a bit more touchy than usual that\u2019s a sure sign you need to confront whatever inner demons are tormenting you. Most likely you have blown the situation out of all proportion, so get your head together and get back on track."}, {"text": "Take a break if you need it, even if it means leaving a pile of unfinished work behind you. Social activities are under excellent stars this weekend, so seek out people who think and act like you and have a good time together. Like attracts like."}, {"text": "If nothing else this weekend you will be more relaxed about your status and position than you have been in recent weeks. Most likely you have finally accepted that life is too short and too precious to waste time on social climbing and petty feuds."}, {"text": "Money may be important but it must not be allowed to come before love. If you get the chance to make someone you have feelings for happy then you must take it, no matter what the financial cost may be. It\u2019s cheap at twice the price!"}, {"text": "Positive cosmic omens on your birthday indicate that the coming year will be both intense and rewarding. Get out into the world and let everyone know who you are and what you have to offer. You won\u2019t be short of opportunities to shine."}, {"text": "You will have a great deal of fun this coming week if you get rid of inhibitions that have been holding you back and just speak and act as the feeling takes you. Don\u2019t worry that some people won\u2019t be impressed \u2013 most people will love you for it."}, {"text": "Try not to let a difference of opinion degenerate into an out and out fight. Use your charm and way with words to smooth over any bad feelings that might arise, especially on the home front. Peace and quiet is what you should be aiming for."}, {"text": "Be careful what words you allow to pass your lips today because partners and loved ones are rather sensitive at the moment and if your words sound harsh they could take it personally and hold a grudge. A little bit of thought will save a lot of anguish."}, {"text": "You will need to be on your guard over the next 24 hours, especially when dealing with people whose outlook on life is radically different to your own. If you let slip information of a personal nature you could find it being used against you later on."}, {"text": "If someone approaches you with what sounds like a brilliant idea by all means consider it. But be aware too that the reason they want to get you involved is so they can lay off most of the risk on you. Do you really want that?"}, {"text": "By all means help someone in need but don\u2019t let them get the idea that you will be there for them every time they slip up. Sometimes you can be a bit gullible and certain people won\u2019t hesitate to take advantage if you let them. So don\u2019t let them."}, {"text": "If you sixth sense warns you that someone is not to be trusted then you must listen to it and act on what it tells you. But don\u2019t go overboard and think the whole world is against you. You have many more friends than enemies."}, {"text": "Speak plainly and clearly so others know where you are coming from, but try to keep any harshness out of your words or you may scare more sensitive sorts away. The way you deliver your message is almost as important as the message itself."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t turn down an opportunity because you are not sure you will be up to the task. Not only will you be up to it but you will make such a success of it that you\u2019ll get asked to take on more responsibility. Make sure you get paid more too."}, {"text": "You rarely take kindly to criticism and what you hear from a work colleague today will annoy you intensely. Even so, they may have a point, so listen to what they have to say and make whatever changes seem necessary. Never stop learning."}, {"text": "You cannot and you must not take anything for granted over the next few days. The cosmic picture is beginning to change and you will have to change with it if you want to move up in the world. Life rarely stands still for long, and neither should you."}, {"text": "Someone you have long admired has done something silly and inevitably your opinion of them has taken a nosedive. But haven\u2019t you done worse things in the past? Try not to be quite so judgmental. Mistakes are a fact of life for everyone."}, {"text": "Your social life will improve dramatically over the coming year and your popularity will lead to all kinds of invitations, both personal and professional. Be selective about who and what you get involved with. There\u2019s only so much of you to go around."}, {"text": "You have nothing to fear and everything to look forward to, so why are you so determined to take a negative view of life? You need to understand that bad thoughts can sometimes lead to bad things. Think positive Aries, today and every day."}, {"text": "You may have to postpone something you were looking forward to today, but come the end of the week you will be glad you were forced to change. The universe knows better than you do what direction your life is destined to take."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to beat your rivals into submission, no matter how much you think they deserve it. Whatever conflict you may be in the middle of at the moment, you can and you must find a compromise solution \u2013 there\u2019s always one available."}, {"text": "If something you are being asked to do does not fit in with your long-term plans then just say \u201cNo\u201d. You are who you are for a reason and you do what you do because it feels right to you, not because others expect it of you."}, {"text": "No, your hopes and wishes have not been dashed. It\u2019s just that the universe knows better than you do that you should be doing something else, something better, something more fulfilling, and is dropping you a massive hint. Take it."}, {"text": "The good times just keep on coming but you must not allow yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security. By all means enjoy what is going on in your life but don\u2019t expect it to last forever. Change is coming \u2013 be ready for it."}, {"text": "You seem rather touchy at the moment, due no doubt to the sun\u2019s journey through the most sensitive area of your chart. Just be careful you don\u2019t say anything that might turn people against you. Look on the bright side and see the good in everyone."}, {"text": "Not everyone believes in the same causes as you, so give friends and loved ones and work colleagues a pass if they don\u2019t seem to care about what maybe you care about too much. Lighten up a little Scorpio, life is supposed to be fun."}, {"text": "There is no point arguing with someone in a position of power, because they clearly have no intention of listening to what you have to say. Either hold your tongue and go along with their plans or cut loose and work for someone else."}, {"text": "You may be out of favour with someone at the moment but don\u2019t let it worry you. You don\u2019t need the patronage of those higher up the ladder of success, you are more than capable of looking after yourself. Maybe that\u2019s what they are worried about!"}, {"text": "You may be tempted to get your own back on someone who gave you a bad time recently, but is it worth the time and the effort? Probably not. You will feel better, about them, about yourself and about life in general, if you forgive and forget."}, {"text": "You may find it hard to put your feelings into words over the next 24 hours but your body language will speak volumes. Let those you love know by your actions that you still think the world of them, no matter what they may have said or done."}, {"text": "Self-belief is not an option, it\u2019s a must. With both Jupiter and Pluto strong on your birthday you clearly have what it takes to reach the top but deep down you still have a few nagging doubts. Get rid of them. You\u2019re not just good, you\u2019re the best!"}, {"text": "Others can follow the herd if they wish but you are far too independent to do the same thing. Start a new trend over the next 24 hours, one that tells the world you have a mind of your own and that you are not afraid to use it."}, {"text": "Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moves into the career area of your chart today, giving your passion to succeed the kind of boost that cannot be ignored. Employers and other important people can see you are going places \u2013 first stop the top!"}, {"text": "One of the best times of the year begins for you today as Mars moves into your fellow air sign of Aquarius. You will become a lot more adventurous over the next few weeks and won\u2019t be afraid to broaden your horizons, mentally and professionally."}, {"text": "You need to face up to an issue that you have been doing your best to avoid. The sooner you find the courage to deal with it the sooner you will be free to move on to better things. Leave yesterday in the past where it belongs."}, {"text": "As Mars moves into your opposite sign today, you will become much more dynamic in one-to-one situations but you could also be a bit too abrasive when dealing with people who get on your nerves. Try not to offend everyone you meet."}, {"text": "You have no choice now but to show the ruthless side of your nature, especially on the work front where if you don\u2019t get on top of a rebellion quickly it could get out of control. Do what you have to do without worrying about other people\u2019s feelings."}, {"text": "As from today you will start to feel more confident about what is going on in your life and by the end of the week you will wonder how on earth you allowed yourself to get so worked up about next to nothing. Don\u2019t let it happen again."}, {"text": "You may prefer to keep your emotions to yourself but that won\u2019t be so easy over the next few days. Loved ones will demand that you open up about your feelings and you know if you don\u2019t they may start thinking you have something to hide."}, {"text": "Be bold, be brave and be the very best Sagittarian you can be today. If you want to get on in the world \u2013 and you do \u2013 you need to push past the mental and emotional barriers that are holding you back. It\u2019s time to reach your full potential."}, {"text": "As Mars leaves your sign today you will need to be a bit more careful about how you use your personal resources. You can no longer afford to scatter your energy in all directions. Focus only on those things that genuinely matter to you."}, {"text": "You can and you must set your sights higher over the next few days. For too long you have been moving ahead but with one foot on the brake. Now you must give yourself permission to move at speed. There is everything to play for and everything to win."}, {"text": "If you need to ask a favour of someone in a position of power you must do so in a positive manner. If you give them the impression that you don\u2019t expect your request to be granted then most likely it won\u2019t be. Body language is so important."}, {"text": "You will find it remarkably easy to get friends and family members to do your bidding over the coming 12 months. For some strange reason all they want to do is to please you, so you might as well please them too and let it happen. Everyone wins!"}, {"text": "Some say that ignorance is bliss but the planets warn if you ignore your problems today not only will they not go away but they may get worse. You need to make a final decision about a very personal issue. You\u2019ve avoided it too long."}, {"text": "By all means speak your mind but try to understand that too much frankness could lead to problems, especially on the home front where loved ones won\u2019t take kindly to being reminded of their flaws. Be a little more sensitive to their feelings."}, {"text": "Now that Mars is moving in your favour again you will be more efficient of mind and more decisive in action. But don\u2019t get so caught up in details that you risk losing sight of the bigger picture. You need to keep reminding yourself what it\u2019s all for."}, {"text": "Start making plans for something big, something that will put you on the map. You have all the courage and confidence you will ever need to tackle problems that on other occasions might have been too much for you. Nothing can defeat you now."}, {"text": "You need to recognize the fact that you will accomplish more in the long-term if you work closely with like-minded people than you will if you try to do it all on your own. It\u2019s time to leave your ego behind and find a new way of living."}, {"text": "Make an effort to talk to people you don\u2019t have much in common with today. You may be surprised to discover that they actually have some very good ideas, at least one of which you can adapt for your own use. Don\u2019t forget to credit them though."}, {"text": "You have so much to be thankful for and so much to look forward to, so why do you look so worried? Whatever the reason you have to get over it because with your ruler Venus so strong at the moment it would be criminal to waste opportunities."}, {"text": "For quite some time you have been working behind the scenes, happy to get on with things without calling attention to yourself. Now, however, you must go to the other extreme and make as much noise as you can. Let the world know you still exist."}, {"text": "If there is someone you need to impress, someone who can make things happen for you, now is the time to turn on the charm and win them over by sheer force of personality. No one can resist you when you really turn it on."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be reluctant to put yourself forward and take the initiative. If you hang back and let others make decisions for you today you will regret it later on when you realize that what they have decided is not right for you. Take control and keep control."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign will bring a number of challenges but it will also bring the drive and the energy and the self-belief you need to overcome them. This is a testing time for you \u2013 and you are destined to pass top of the class!"}, {"text": "You must not be afraid to take risks today. It may be true that what you stand to lose if you get something wrong is more than what you stand to gain if you get it right, but what matters is that you show the world your fighting spirit."}, {"text": "Someone older and wiser will make a big impression on you over the coming year, to the extent that you may consider changing your life in drastic ways. You don\u2019t need to go that far \u2013 just adapt what you learn from them and make it work for you."}, {"text": "Before you criticize someone for expecting something for nothing make sure they cannot criticize you for exactly the same thing. As an Aries, for some reason, you sometimes forget that you are subject to the same rules as everyone else!"}, {"text": "You need to find ways to get along with someone who rubs you the wrong way. Like it or not, you are going to have to work with them over the next few days, so forget about your differences and focus on what you have in common."}, {"text": "Life is not a race and the winner is not always the one who moves the fastest. You would be wise to slow things down a bit today, even if it means cutting back on activities you enjoy. Speed isn\u2019t everything, as you are about to find out."}, {"text": "No matter how tough things have been of late, you now have a new lust for living and intend to make up for all the time you wasted feeling glum. Deny yourself nothing. Indulge your every whim. Life is too short to worry about consequences."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that something will get to you today and make you retreat into your shell. Don\u2019t sulk too long though because not only do you have important things to do but someone wants to reward you for recent efforts. Don\u2019t push them away."}, {"text": "Jupiter in the communications area of your chart means you are under no obligation to tone down your opinions. On the contrary, you must speak up and let someone know loud and clear that you do not approve of their actions. So the truth hurts \u2013so what?"}, {"text": "All eyes will be on you today and although you don\u2019t usually enjoy being the centre of attention, on this occasion you won\u2019t mind a bit. Your more outgoing attitude will be noted by someone in a position of power, who may offer you a promotion."}, {"text": "Everything is right with your world at the moment and with both Jupiter and Venus energizing your sign not even the occasional setback can knock you off your stride. Your positive outlook on life will bring both personal and professional rewards."}, {"text": "You have feelings like everyone else (though they\u2019re not always apparent) and what occurs over the next 24 hours could even bring a tear to your eye. Don\u2019t be afraid to admit that you need a shoulder to cry on. Even Sags need emotional support."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the friendship area of your chart will make it easy to win people round to your way of thinking, even if your way of thinking is wrong. But don\u2019t expect them to put their money where your mouth is \u2013 it won\u2019t happen."}, {"text": "You have been waiting in the wings long enough and now the time has come to take centre stage and make it your own. Put yourself forward today and show the world what you can do \u2013 just about anything if you choose to put your mind to it."}, {"text": "You seem more relaxed now, more in tune with the spirit of the times. It\u2019s amazing how good life can feel when you stop making a big issue of everything and simply live in and enjoy the moment. You\u2019ll feel somewhere between good and great today!"}, {"text": "You are determined to prove your creative worth, which is good, but there is a risk that what you create over the coming year will be seen by some people as a challenge to their beliefs. That\u2019s okay though \u2013 someone has to be the controversial one."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t know all the facts of a situation you must not make any hard and fast decisions. Also, be careful that in your rush to do good deeds for people you don\u2019t overlook information that might make you think twice about what you are doing."}, {"text": "A mistake you made a long time ago will come back to haunt you today and, yes, it will be embarrassing. But what exactly should you be ashamed of? The fact that you made a mistake, however bad, is evidence that you tried. So few do."}, {"text": "It\u2019s a shame that you are so caught up in your own problems that you have no idea what others are struggling with, because you could learn from each other. Listen to what people tell you\u2013 it could lead you to an answer you have been searching for."}, {"text": "The more you try to slow down and give your body time to recover the more your workload piles up in front of you. You need to call a halt and let others know that enough is enough. No new tasks until the old ones are cleared."}, {"text": "The more enthusiastic you are about a new project the more you must keep a hold on the purse strings. If you just throw yourself at it without thinking about how it needs to be financed it could quickly eat into your resources."}, {"text": "You seem so sure of yourself at the moment that nothing can faze you, but you need to be aware that your confidence makes you a target. Your rivals would love nothing better than to take you down a peg or two. Don\u2019t make it easy for them."}, {"text": "Keep all kinds of personal information to yourself today. There is a side to your nature that likes to talk but the planets warn if you say too much over the next 24 hours your words could be used against you by your rivals, so be careful."}, {"text": "The only reason certain people are being critical of you now is because they envy your ability to switch off from outside influences and live in the moment. The more they say you should change your ways the more you should carry on as you are."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of the mind, is now at odds with Neptune, which among other things means you will need to make an extra-special effort to stay sharp and not let your thoughts drift all over the place. Know your own mind and how to use it."}, {"text": "You seem to believe that if you let down your guard for even a moment your enemies will be at your throat in a flash. Maybe they will, but no way will they win. It takes more than big talk and threats to bring down a Capricorn."}, {"text": "A new project is sure to take up a lot of time and energy between now and the end of the year, so make sure it\u2019s what you truly want to be doing and get other people involved too so you can spread the load as much as possible."}, {"text": "You should know by now that things begun in haste are often repented at leisure, so don\u2019t do anything drastic and don\u2019t make promises you may not be able to keep. This is very much a day for taking things easy. Move slower and enjoy life more."}, {"text": "How you interact with people on a group or social level is going to be of the utmost importance over the coming 12 months. You need to make a conscious decision to view everyone you meet as your spiritual equal. Look beyond superficial differences."}, {"text": "The more other people try to pressure you into making a quick decision about something the more you must take your time. Keep them waiting and make sure they get the message that they don\u2019t put pressure on you \u2013 you put pressure on them!"}, {"text": "If you make an effort to work with people as part of a team this weekend you will be rewarded in ways you cannot imagine later in the month. Remember though that principles must always come before profit. It\u2019s not all about money."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if you encounter some kind of setback today \u2013 most likely it is just the universe\u2019s way of telling you to slow down a bit. Delays may in fact work in your favour as it will be those who move fastest who get the least done."}, {"text": "It\u2019s great that your self-belief is sky-high at the moment, but don\u2019t fall into the trap of making promises that you may not be able to keep. It won\u2019t look good if you make guarantees one day then have to backtrack on them the next."}, {"text": "If you want to move up in the world and be someone special you will need to open up about your ambitions and let others know what you see yourself doing five or even 10 years into the future. Making plans is important as it keeps your mind sharp."}, {"text": "Life is quite easy for you at the moment, which is nice, but it could also be dangerous in that you could find it hard to motivate yourself later on when decisive action is called for. Try setting yourself challenges for the fun of it today."}, {"text": "Sometimes the best way to move forward is to go back first and sweep away everything that went before, and that is what you must do now. Think \u201ccreative destruction\u201d and throw out everything from your past life that you no longer need."}, {"text": "Let partners and loved ones and friends and even work colleagues know exactly how you feel at the moment, even if \u2013 especially if \u2013 you don\u2019t feel good about life. Even Scorpios need emotional support now and again. You\u2019ll get it if you open up."}, {"text": "No doubt you believe you have what it takes to be a success, but success will come quicker, and last longer, if you can stop thinking in terms of winning and losing. Work for others as well as yourself now and ultimately everyone will win."}, {"text": "Sometimes you are far too modest about your achievements and that is something you need to overcome this weekend. There are not many people out there who can claim to be as accomplished in the game of life as you are. Enjoy your successes."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be afraid to push a little bit harder than you usually do this weekend, and don\u2019t hesitate to demand that partners and loved ones and work colleagues follow your example. If you give 100 per cent then everyone else should, too."}, {"text": "There are so many things going on in your life at the moment that you could easily lose sight of the bigger picture. Take time out to think about what you are doing and what it\u2019s all for. Is there a master plan behind your actions? There should be."}, {"text": "The message of your birthday chart is that you need to learn how to be more self-sufficient. Yes, of course, you will always need other people, and they will always need you, but the more you can do on your own the sooner you will reach your potential."}, {"text": "What seems logical to you may look silly, even absurd, to a friend or colleague, so don\u2019t expect to be able to work together toward a common goal. Later in the week you will understand each other a bit better, so bide your time and your time will come."}, {"text": "You have been focusing so much on one issue that you have failed to notice that an equally important issue has crept up on you. What occurs today will make it abundantly clear what needs to be done \u2013 and you\u2019ve got the whole week to do it."}, {"text": "You know what you want to do and you have a pretty good idea about how best to go about it, but something is still holding you back. Whatever that something might be, rest assured that it will be gone by this time next week \u2013 so keep making plans."}, {"text": "You may be of the opinion that certain aims and ambitions are beyond you, that no matter how hard you strive your efforts will always fall short, but that isn\u2019t true. Raise your thinking, then raise your game and very soon you\u2019ll be flying high."}, {"text": "Certain people have been painting a far too rosy picture of what\u2019s been going on in your world and what happens over the next few days will bring that fact home to you. Are things really so bad? Of course not, but you do need to face up to reality."}, {"text": "You may think that you can cope with any and every challenge that is thrown at you but what happens today will remind you that some things get done better when they are done with other people. Teamwork is very much the keyword for the week ahead."}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to solve your problems by running away from then and in recent weeks have made heroic efforts to face up to a number of painful issues. Now the pain is passing and from here on in there will be more laughs than tears."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to risk a lot on something you believe will work in your favour but can you be 100 per cent certain of that? There is no such thing as a sure thing so, yes, take that risk, but have a fallback plan . . . just in case."}, {"text": "Say what you have to say today but don\u2019t say so much that you turn important people against you. As communications planet Mercury is moving in your favour again you\u2019ll find your voice with ease \u2013 but go easy on how you choose to use it."}, {"text": "Usually you are open to taking advice but just lately you have been enjoying life so much that you may have ignored opinions you don\u2019t want to hear. As from today though you need to wise up and recognize that not all news can be good news."}, {"text": "The cosmic picture is beginning to shift in your favour and over the next few days you can expect good news of one sort or another. It may be another week or so until it all comes together but life is now definitely heading in the right direction."}, {"text": "Try not to read too much into a minor difference of opinion with a friend or relative, because what seems so important today will be of no significance to either of you tomorrow. Life always changes, and your outlook needs to keep changing too."}, {"text": "You must not let the doubters and cynics talk you out of what you are planning to do. It\u2019s your life and it is entirely up to you what you choose do with it, so follow your instincts and let everyone know that you intend to follow your dream."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t HAVE to be different, Aries. You don\u2019t HAVE to constantly show that you are not the sort to follow the herd. Sometimes it\u2019s okay to go with the flow and let others call the tune for a while. Such a time is now, so relax."}, {"text": "You may feel an overwhelming need to prove yourself but the planets warn if you push too hard or move too fast you could make the kind of mistake that does your reputation no good at all. Be ambitious by all means, but be sensible too."}, {"text": "There will be times over the next few days when you feel out of your depth, but that\u2019s okay. Others may know more than you but that does not mean you are inferior in any way. Learn from them and add it to your own experience."}, {"text": "You may be super busy at the moment but you must still make time too for those who depend on you for their emotional wellbeing. Partners and loved ones may not be as dynamic as you, so make allowances if they are feeling a bit down."}, {"text": "You must not suppress your natural instincts. You are who you are for a good cosmic reason and anyone who says you should try to be different is wrong. Listen to the little voice inside your head today and do only what it tells you."}, {"text": "You seem to have developed a reputation as a bit of a cold fish in recent months and that\u2019s something you need to change. Start by being more open with friends and relatives about how you feel. There is nothing wrong with having feelings."}, {"text": "You may not be looking forward to what you have to do, but the more time you spend worrying about it the worse it will be. Whatever it is you are expected to take care of just throw yourself at it with energy and enthusiasm. You\u2019ll survive."}, {"text": "Think carefully before agreeing to get involved in a project that a friend or colleague claims is guaranteed to succeed. You know what they say about \u201ccertainties\u201d \u2013 they do not exist! The planets warn this is one offer you can afford to turn down."}, {"text": "You are strongly advised not to allow yourself to get dragged into a situation that has nothing to do with you either personally or professionally. No matter what the long-term rewards might be it is not worth the short-term stress. Give it a miss."}, {"text": "There is no such thing as a \u201cfree lunch\u201d and if you don\u2019t know that by now you will very soon. Whatever it is you are given over the next 24 hours you can be sure that you will have to give something in return. Forewarned is forearmed."}, {"text": "Sometimes you can be too rigid in your thinking and you need to learn how to stand back from your own opinions and see why other people take an opposing viewpoint. You may not agree with them, but at least you will understand them."}, {"text": "Do something different over the next few days, something that causes a bit of a stir. You may not think of yourself as a radical or revolutionary but deep down there is a part of you that enjoys rocking the boat. Rock it today and see who falls out!"}, {"text": "A Mars-Uranus link on your birthday this year will encourage you to be more adventurous, which is good, but could also lead to you taking unnecessary risks, which is bad. Your \u201ccan do\u201d attitude needs to be combined with common sense."}, {"text": "Why do you look so worried? Why is your attitude so negative? Most likely it has something to do with today\u2019s link between your ruler Mars and Uranus, planet of upheavals, which has you dreading the future. Don\u2019t dread it \u2013 enjoy it!"}, {"text": "You may feel that someone you work or do business with has let you down and deserves to feel the edge of your tongue, but ask yourself: will it make the situation better or worse? Bite your lip and do what you can to improve things together."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t think you should be taking orders from someone then make sure they know about it and make sure they cannot get you into a position where you have no choice in the matter. Make this the day that you seize back control."}, {"text": "Take whatever time you need to reach a decision that is likely to have far-reaching consequences both for you and for other people. Anyone who tries to rush you is not your friend and may even be an enemy. Take your time and get it right."}, {"text": "Sometimes it is necessary to tell a small lie in order to save someone you love from the consequences of their actions. Yes, of course, honesty is usually the best policy but on this occasion bending the truth a little is the right thing to do."}, {"text": "By all means be generous with your time today but don\u2019t be so generous with your money or your ideas. If you give too much away, financially or creatively, you could find that others get rich at your expense, and they don\u2019t deserve to."}, {"text": "You may want to prove yourself to those who doubt you that you are more than just a pretty face, but don\u2019t go too far and take on responsibilities that clearly you are not qualified to handle. Expect good things of yourself but don\u2019t try to do everything."}, {"text": "You must stay focused on the tasks that are important to you, no matter how much others try to get you involved in what they are doing. There are only so many hours in a day and not even a Scorpio can find ways to add to them."}, {"text": "It would appear that someone is trying their hardest to undermine your confidence. They don\u2019t know you very well, do they? Sagittarius is a sign that seldom has doubts and if your rivals don\u2019t know that by now then they\u2019re not very smart."}, {"text": "When dealing with business and financial matters you must \u2013 repeat, must \u2013 make sure you read all the small print. Don\u2019t skip over the details just because you think you know them already. If you do, you could miss something very important."}, {"text": "With your ruling planet Uranus at odds with energy planet Mars today there is a danger you could over-commit yourself and do yourself some physical damage. Even an Aquarius has limits, so be smart and stay within your comfort zone, for now."}, {"text": "PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):"}, {"text": "Stick with what you know today and don\u2019t be tempted to stray into areas where your expertise is limited. It\u2019s good that you want to extend yourself but you need to take it a step at a time. More than that could prove too much for you."}, {"text": "According to the planets you have put so much time and energy into one aim that an equally important one has suffered. Now you must balance things out and make sure that you can move ahead on two fronts at the same time. Give yourself another option."}, {"text": "It\u2019s time to give up on something that simply isn\u2019t working out the way you wanted it to. It\u2019s not a sign of failure on your part, far from it in fact. You took a chance and gave it your best shot, and that\u2019s more than most people do."}, {"text": "You may have to put a creative project on hold for a while, at least until the sun changes signs at the weekend. You have so many things on the go that it\u2019s unlikely you can do it justice \u2013 but you can come back to it later on."}, {"text": "You may not entirely trust what a friend or colleague is telling you but you can sense there is some truth in it and that you will need to take action of some kind. Let your instincts guide you and don\u2019t be afraid to upset powerful people."}, {"text": "Cancer may not be one of the more outgoing of signs but while the sun remains in the travel area of your chart you will want to be on the move. Don\u2019t go too far today though as a family issue may require your input. Short journeys only."}, {"text": "The best way to deal with people who insist on making a drama out of a crisis is to stay calm and let them see that you won\u2019t allow yourself to be panicked. Someone needs to keep a cool head and that someone may have to be you."}, {"text": "The sun is coming to the end of its journey through your sign and that means you need to quickly finish a project that has some sort of deadline. Don\u2019t try to do everything, just do the one thing that really matters really well."}, {"text": "Recent weeks have seen you give some serious thought to what you are going to do in the future and when the sun enters your sign on the 23rd you can turn those thoughts into deeds. And remember: the future is what you choose to make of it."}, {"text": "If you take the opposite viewpoint to what everyone else claims to believe there is every chance that you will be one of the few people who makes the right call. You have never been one to get caught up in the herd mentality, so don\u2019t start now!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart has brought a great deal of pressure in recent weeks, but you have handled it well and impressed those who have the power to reward you. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for a raise or a promotion."}, {"text": "Why is a friend acting in ways that can only hurt them in the long-term? Is it because they just don\u2019t care, or is it their way of calling for assistance? According to the planets it could well be the latter, so what can you do to help them?"}, {"text": "The last few weeks have no doubt been frustrating but when the sun moves into your fellow air sign of Libra at the weekend what seemed so difficult in the past will suddenly look easy. Practise your smile \u2013 you\u2019re going to need it!"}, {"text": "If you can defeat a rival once and for all you must follow through and make sure they are never in a position to challenge you again. Don\u2019t let your big heart get in the way. There is no reason why you should feel sorry for them."}, {"text": "It may at times seem as if you have missed your chance in life but that simply isn\u2019t true. It is always possible to start again, from where you are now, and reach a goal or destination that makes you happy. Give it some thought then enjoy life again."}, {"text": "You can get people to do things for you without making loud demands. You possess a considerable amount of charm \u2013 for when you care to use it \u2013 and if you say the right words in the right way today no one will be able to resist you."}, {"text": "You have started a lot of new projects of late but you are beginning to realize that you won\u2019t be able to continue with all of them. Start looking at what you are doing with a more critical eye and, where necessary, be ruthless with your plans."}, {"text": "There may have been one or two dark days in recent weeks but now the cosmic tide is beginning to turn and before you know it, everything will be sweetness and light again. Okay, so maybe it won\u2019t be quite that good, but it WILL be much better."}, {"text": "Your social life has been good of late and you are advised to make the most of it over the next few days, because when the sun changes signs on the 23rd a less lighthearted phase will begin. You have responsibilities that cannot be avoided forever."}, {"text": "Money matters of one sort or another have been giving you cause for concern but the planets indicate that your financial position may not be as bad as you think. Either way, your cash-flow situation will improve over the next few days."}, {"text": "The sun leaves your sign at the end of this week but that does not mean life will grind to a halt. On the contrary, you will be busier than ever making sure your wonderful ideas get the chance to see the light of day. Don\u2019t switch off yet."}, {"text": "In a matter of days both the sun and Mercury, planet of the mind, will move into your sign and a new phase will begin. You don\u2019t have to do anything special, just listen to your heart and follow your instincts. Deep down you already know the way."}, {"text": "There has been a lot of coming and going in recent weeks and you could do with a breather. You will get one soon enough, but today you need to redouble your efforts and make sure friends and relatives continue to move in the right direction."}, {"text": "You have achieved much in recent weeks and no doubt you feel you could carry on at your current frantic pace for a while longer. No doubt you could but even a Sag has limits. Start slowing down a bit or you could hit the proverbial wall."}, {"text": "When the sun moves into the career area of your chart next weekend you will get the chance to put your big ideas to the test. Any one of them could change your life for the better but one idea in particular stands head and shoulders above the rest."}, {"text": "No matter how difficult life has been in recent weeks what happens in the very near future will more than make up for it. Trust that the universe will both guide and protect you and listen to the little voice that whispers in your head. It knows the way."}, {"text": "The more you try to change your ways the more you end up doing the same things and making the same mistakes. Perhaps you should take the hint and stop trying so hard. You are who you are for a reason, so why not embrace that fact today?"}, {"text": "Your mind will work fast over the coming year and you will see things that other people miss and understand things that had previously confused you. You may or may not discover the meaning of life but life will certainly have more meaning for you."}, {"text": "You can sense that something is coming to a head and that it will be mega. Whatever occurs you cannot ignore it or run away from it. Face up to events as and when they happen and never doubt that you have what it takes to come through smiling."}, {"text": "You may not be much at taking care of details but that will by necessity change over the next few days. Cosmic activity in the work area of your chart means that even quite minor details could result in major consequences, so stay alert."}, {"text": "Life is about to get so much better and even if you don\u2019t quite believe that now you will believe it come the start of next week. A lot will depend on how you have dealt with personal issues in recent weeks \u2013 and you\u2019ve dealt with them well."}, {"text": "According to the planets you will have to cut back on your social life this coming weekend while you focus on matters of a family and domestic nature. Tonight though you are still free to go out and have fun \u2013 so don\u2019t hold back!"}, {"text": "Nothing much will change over the next 24 hours but you can feel on some inner level that a new cycle is about to begin. It promises to be a positive one too, enabling you to look at life through fresh eyes after so much recent disappointment."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Mercury union in your sign means you can, if you choose, do something dramatic and important today, but you don\u2019t have to. The cosmic picture is beginning to change and your circumstances will change soon too \u2013 for the better."}, {"text": "The old solar year is coming to an end and by the time the sun moves into your sign on Sunday, your outlook on life will have improved tenfold. The next four weeks are sure to be special, but what can you do to make them extra special?"}, {"text": "You must not let any weird or wonderful ideas take hold in your mind today and over the weekend. Your fears and anxieties are not based on anything real but mainly exist only in your head, and can thus be safely ignored."}, {"text": "There are so many options open to you at the moment that you may be confused as to which route to take. All will become clear when the sun moves in your favour this coming weekend, so be open to new ideas and be ready to act."}, {"text": "If you are having doubts about what you are working on then you might as well stop for a while and give both your mind and body a rest. With the sun about to move into the career area of your chart the way ahead will soon become clear."}, {"text": "If you are tired of the same old faces and the same old scene you will soon get an opportunity to change things. Cosmic activity in the most adventurous area of your chart over the next few days will inspire you to look further afield for your pleasures."}, {"text": "If your financial situation is not as healthy as you would like it to be then what happens over the next few weeks will give you the chance to balance the books again. Try to stay in control of your spending habits in the future."}, {"text": "You know that you are in the right and that those who disagree with you will pay the price for getting it wrong. Don\u2019t get too complacent about life though. The universe has a way of bringing down to earth those who start believing they know it all."}, {"text": "Have you said too much or have you said too little? At some stage this weekend other people will leave you in no doubt what they think about your communication skills. If they criticize you, don\u2019t take it too much to heart. Learn from what they say."}, {"text": "Life does not have a duty to come to you and the sooner you come to terms with that fact the better. If you take the attitude that everything you want will just fall in your lap this weekend it\u2019s quite likely you will be disappointed."}, {"text": "The more others sing your praises now the more likely it is they will want something from you later on. What you should be asking yourself is: What do you want from them? The omens are good that you can come to a mutually beneficial deal."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to suffer in silence, Cancer. If you need help just ask for it. You may be surprised to discover that friends, colleagues and even strangers are more than happy to come to your aid. You have, after all, done plenty for them in the past."}, {"text": "Some people appear to believe that you are spending more time enjoying yourself than you are taking care of business of one kind or another, and they are right, you are. Don\u2019t change to please them \u2013 it\u2019s important that you please yourself."}, {"text": "You appear to be in a spendthrift mood at the moment, which is not like you at all. Try to avoid the temptation to waste large sums of money on things you don\u2019t need \u2013 or at least keep the receipts so you can get a refund later on!"}, {"text": "If you confront what you are scared of this weekend you will find that it no longer has any kind of hold or power over you. Face up to your fear and try to understand that it is just one more illusion that can safely be ignored."}, {"text": "At some stage today or tomorrow it will be quite obvious to you that people are telling you what they think you desire to hear. It is essential that you demand to know what is really going on in their minds. And be prepared to be shocked!"}, {"text": "The more desperate someone seems to be to get you involved in their latest plan or project the more you should hold off and wait to see how things develop. Chances are there is nothing to worry about but you can\u2019t be too careful."}, {"text": "You are now moving into a phase where, if you know what you want and if you are prepared to work harder than your rivals, all things are possible. You have never been one to do things by half measures, so success is assured."}, {"text": "Something you thought would never work will suddenly start going well for you this weekend. So what has changed? Most likely your big brain, without you realizing it, has started to piece things together so you now understand what needs to be done."}, {"text": "This is a very busy time for you, so pace yourself sensibly and don\u2019t take on so much over the next 48 hours that you risk burning yourself out. There are just a few things that have to be done and many things you can safely ignore."}, {"text": "Trust what your inner voice tells you over the coming 12 months, even if people with more experience than you tell you the opposite. Deep down you already know what you should be doing with your life, so quiet your mind and listen \u2013 and then act!"}, {"text": "If you must point out where a friend or family member has been going wrong at least try to make your words sound positive. For the sake of your long-term relationship you need to be a bit more subtle than usual when handing out criticism."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be much interested in work today, but that\u2019s okay. The last few weeks have been intensely busy and it\u2019s natural that there should be some sort of reaction. Give yourself time to replenish both your physical and mental energy. "}, {"text": "This is no time to be indecisive where an affair of the heart is concerned. If you need to let someone know how much you care for them then come right out and say it. Don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t slap your face for coming on too strong! "}, {"text": "There are many things you can get emotional about but the one thing you must not abandon logic and reason over is money. If an investment plan of some sort has not lived up to expectations then pull your cash out of it immediately."}, {"text": "A problem will only be a problem today if you are determined to think of it as a problem. If, on the other hand, you think of it as a challenge then most likely it won\u2019t be a problem at all. Sometimes Leo you take life far too seriously."}, {"text": "As the sun leaves your birth sign today so your energy, both mental and physical, may tail off a bit, but that is to be expected. It\u2019s just a sign that you need to slow down and focus on one or two aims rather than one or two dozen."}, {"text": "The sun moves into your sign today and already you can sense that your luck could be changing for the better. Indeed it is, but good things won\u2019t just happen as if by magic \u2013 it\u2019s up to you to seize the initiative and get things started. Start now!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t rush into something that you are not 100 per cent certain is in your best interests. At this time of year you are desperate to achieve things but you also need to be aware of events going on around you \u2013 and how they could impact on you."}, {"text": "If you have your doubts about what a friend or family member is up to then you must speak up. They may be annoyed with you interfering to begin with but it won\u2019t be long before they realize you are right \u2013 and then they won\u2019t stop thanking you!"}, {"text": "If you feel like doing something out of the ordinary, or even outrageous, don\u2019t think twice about it, just do it. The eyes of the world will be on you over the next few days, so pull out all the stops and give them something worth watching."}, {"text": "This is going to be a good week for friendships of all kinds, and even if a relationship has not been going well of late it will start to go well now. You don\u2019t have to do anything special, you just need to be ready to have fun together."}, {"text": "Someone seems to believe that they are in your debt and wants to repay you. Even if you don\u2019t actually want anything from them you should find a way they can help you. It will make them feel good about themselves, and that\u2019s a nice aim in itself."}, {"text": "A Mars-Mercury link on your birthday will do wonders both for your mind and your ability to communicate. Your powers of persuasion are such that no one will be able to deny you what it is you desire. Try not to get carried away though!"}, {"text": "Someone who has more experience in certain areas than you will point you in the right direction today and if you are smart you will do what they say. Don\u2019t let your ego get in the way. You cannot possibly know everything Aries!"}, {"text": "You will find yourself in a number of challenging situations over the next few days, and you will master each and every one of them. Your ability to stay calm when under immense pressure will do your reputation no harm at all."}, {"text": "Some rather strange people will come into your life this week but it won\u2019t faze you one little bit. You rather enjoy mixing with those who are different in some way \u2013 it\u2019s part of your Gemini nature to be attracted to bizarre situations."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t get angry if every time you come up with an idea someone tries to shoot it down. Constant criticism is something you will have to get used to over the next few weeks, because others are sure to be jealous of your skill and success."}, {"text": "Be careful today when dealing with cash and material things such as property and possessions. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone will try to cheat you as such but it will be easy to make the kind of mistakes that could cost you serious money."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, force others to go along with your plans but if you do, you will sour at least one important relationship, and maybe several. You don\u2019t need to be pushy to get things done, you just need to turn on the charm."}, {"text": "Forget about the past and focus only on the future. What\u2019s done is done and cannot be undone, so get rid of any negative thoughts and feelings you may have and start a new life for yourself right now. Each day can be a new beginning."}, {"text": "A friend or family member will say something today that does not fit with what you want to believe about yourself or the world in general. Be that as it may it is obvious that they are correct, so it\u2019s you who must change your ways."}, {"text": "You are never afraid to speak your mind and friends and work colleagues will be impressed today by your willingness to call it as you see it. However, employers and other important people may not be quite so amused, so watch your back!"}, {"text": "The more noise you have made about what you are going to accomplish the more you will be expected to deliver. The sun in the career area of your chart at this time of year makes you intensely ambitious, but are your aims realistic?"}, {"text": "You must not let your mind slip into negative modes of thinking this week, because it will be so hard to snap yourself out of it. As you think so you are, so think happy and you will be happy, which in turn will make success more likely."}, {"text": "It may seem as if certain people are being selfish, and maybe they are, but why should that worry you? The message of the stars today is that it is not what other people do that matters but how you choose to react to it. Choose to be positive."}, {"text": "A full moon on your birthday, as well as a powerful sun-Saturn link, means you will be challenged again and again over the coming 12 months. Never doubt you have what it takes and never doubt you have the right to take whatever makes you happy."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s full moon in your sign could see you acting in ways that are guaranteed to get a negative response from those around you. Whatever grievances you may have you must keep a lid on them. If you explode it will be you who suffers most."}, {"text": "So much seems to be happening at the moment and if you are honest you will admit that you don\u2019t understand it all. But that\u2019s okay. Just because you cannot see the bigger picture does not mean the bigger picture does not exist."}, {"text": "The more you socialize over the next few days the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Make an effort to get out and about and make sure you spend time with people who know how to have fun."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to tell someone in a position of authority what you think of them today but the full moon warns that is not a good idea. It\u2019s quite likely you will need this person\u2019s support very soon, so don\u2019t burn your bridges."}, {"text": "Everyone is entitled to their opinion and you must keep that fact in mind today if you want to avoid the kind of arguments and confrontations that can easily ruin friendships. Put your side of the story by all means, but listen to the other side too."}, {"text": "Take care you don\u2019t fall out with someone you may need to stay on good terms with. Your financial situation is such at the moment that you cannot afford to end alliances just because you don\u2019t like the way certain people choose to operate."}, {"text": "You must not allow other people to dictate to you in any way, shape or form, today, not even if you and they believe it is for your own good. Once they find they can tell you what to do you will find it hard to break free again."}, {"text": "If you allow yourself to be talked into doing something you don\u2019t want to do it\u2019s quite likely you will regret it before the end of the week. There is no easy way to say \u201cNo\u201d to people you like and admire but it has to be done."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s full moon will encourage you to be even more outspoken than you usually are but if you say too much it could cause all kinds of trouble later on. Affairs of the heart, especially, need to be handled with a great deal of care."}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s full moon cuts across a major angle of your chart you must expect a certain amount of opposition, both in your personal life and at work. You must not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 react in an emotional manner. Stay calm and the storm will pass."}, {"text": "You seem to be a bit excitable at the moment, which isn\u2019t like you at all. Maybe it\u2019s the influence of the full moon but whatever the reason your passions are clearly running high. Just be careful they don\u2019t run away with you completely!"}, {"text": "Be careful what you spend your money on today because once you start flashing the cash you may not be able to stop. Above all you need to realize that you are under no obligation to help other people financially. Give love, not money."}, {"text": "If you feel the need to transform your life, to change your existence in major ways, now is the time to move from the thinking about it stage to the doing it stage. Just take one small step in the right direction, then keep walking. Soon you\u2019ll be flying!"}, {"text": "If you need help today you must ask for it. Don\u2019t worry that friends and colleagues might think less of you \u2013 everyone needs assistance once in a while, even an Aries. It\u2019s time to recognize that you are only human, and all humans have weaknesses."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the work area of your chart means that others expect you to deliver and if you don\u2019t your reputation could quickly head south. In future you might like to think twice before agreeing to take on so many new jobs!"}, {"text": "Creative activities and affairs of the heart are under excellent stars now and if you have not yet got the rewards and applause you think you are entitled to, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a matter of time. Forget about everything else and focus on success."}, {"text": "It\u2019s good to let off steam once in a while but don\u2019t complain too loudly that you have been hard done by. The planets warn if you make too much noise certain people may try to make life even more difficult for you than it is now."}, {"text": "You will have plenty to say for yourself today and that\u2019s good because too often you keep quiet when you really should speak up. Just make sure that any claims you make can be backed up by facts, because your enemies will check up on them."}, {"text": "You need to pay much more attention to your resources. For too long you have drifted along not worrying too much about where the money comes from, and even less about where it goes to, but that will soon need to change. Earn more and spend less!"}, {"text": "All things are possible for you now. No, really, they are! As the sun moves through the most dynamic area of your chart you will find it increasingly easy to make good things happen, both for yourself and for other people. Be amazing Libra!"}, {"text": "What you need to keep in mind today is that no matter how bad things might seem now they will get better. The sun in the most sensitive area of your chart at this time of year makes things look a bit gloomy, but you can still shine."}, {"text": "You are rarely troubled by self-doubt and even if things go wrong today you will carry on regardless and let nothing faze you. Experience has taught you that events have a way of turning out right in the end. It seems to be a cosmic law."}, {"text": "Important people are watching you closely, so make sure they like what they see. Capricorn is a sign that always finishes what it starts and that fact alone will help you stand out from the crowd. You possess staying power and that\u2019s rare."}, {"text": "The sun in Libra at this time of year makes you more adventurous than usual, so head off some place new and enjoy yourself. Even if you can\u2019t get away at short notice at least start planning your next vacation. Always have something to look forward to."}, {"text": "The planets warn that you have been living beyond your means for too long and the time of reckoning will soon be here. Don\u2019t worry though \u2013 the universe will bring new opportunities your way. But it\u2019s you who must take advantage of them."}, {"text": "A sun-Mars link on your birthday will endow you with the kind of energy levels that make all things possible. But don\u2019t try to do everything. Focus on your No. 1 aim and make that the focus of the year ahead. Greatness awaits you."}, {"text": "You should be having the time of your life now and today\u2019s sun-Mars link promises it will be fun all the way. This is also a good time for affairs of the heart and there is every chance you are about to meet some pretty amazing people."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t seem to have a care in the world at the moment, which is nice, but don\u2019t start thinking that life will always be this easy. On the work front, especially, there will be a number of challenges over the next few days, so stay alert."}, {"text": "Socially and romantically this is one of the best times of the year for you, so put chores on hold and don\u2019t let anyone burst the bubble of happiness that surrounds you. Your positive attitude will help others be positive too. Everybody wins!"}, {"text": "Be generous with your time today and do what you can to help those who are not having it anywhere near as easy as you are. The more you help others now the more the universe will help you later on. Good deeds are good business."}, {"text": "This is no time to stick with tried and tested methods \u2013 you must be more adventurous. An excellent sun-Mars link will help you be more creative and also make it easier for you to communicate with like-minded people. Go for it Leo!"}, {"text": "The best way to avoid unpleasant situations is to ignore them. Keep telling yourself that no matter what other people may say and do you are the only one who controls what occurs in your life. Avoid confrontation at all costs today."}, {"text": "The sun in your sign will bring all sorts of new and interesting possibilities your way and today\u2019s sun-Mars link will give you the drive and the energy to take full advantage of them. Life is what you choose to make of it, so make it a masterpiece!"}, {"text": "Make sure that important people know who you are and what you can do. If you feel that a change of job, or even a whole new career path, would be of benefit to you then go for it. You don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s permission to move on."}, {"text": "Get out and about and meet people today because someone you encounter on your travels could play a major role in your life. And don\u2019t limit yourself to the kind of people you already know about \u2013 be a bit more adventurous in your friendships."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s highly positive cosmic picture urges you to let go of fear and let fate take its course. The changes you are going through at the moment may be unsettling but one day you will look back and realize they were exactly what you needed."}, {"text": "Even if you are the kind of Aquarius who prefers to keep your emotions under control you will want to express yourself openly and joyously today. There are so many good things going on in your life right now, so stand up and shout about it!"}, {"text": "If you make an effort to get on with people today there is no limit to how much you can accomplish. It will also help if you can learn to accept that some people simply do not want to do the things that you do. It\u2019s no big deal."}, {"text": "The most important thing this year is that you keep faith with yourself. Others may doubt you but you must never doubt yourself. The skills and talents you were born with will find a highly rewarding outlet over the coming 12 months."}, {"text": "Try not to be so aggressive in your opinions today. By all means stand up for what you believe but there is no need to make a war of it. You can disagree with both friends and foes and still find ways to get along on a personal level."}, {"text": "If someone in a position of authority says or does something that you fundamentally disagree with today try not to let it get to you personally. The planets warn if you choose to make a fight of it most likely it will be you who loses."}, {"text": "You have always been a bit of a rebel and the more others try to tell you what you should be doing today the more you are likely to ignore them. Watch out for double bluffs though \u2013 someone may say one thing knowing you will do the opposite."}, {"text": "If you feel that a rumor of some sort is damaging your credibility then you must do something about it. If you try to ignore it others may take that as a sign that what is being said about you is true. It\u2019s not, so speak up!"}, {"text": "One-to-one relationships seem to be more troublesome than usual, due no doubt to the presence of Mars in your opposite sign. Keep reminding yourself that life is not a battle. More will be achieved over time by compromise and cooperation."}, {"text": "You are strongly advised not to make any new plans for the coming weekend as you have too much on your plate already. If an authority figure asks you to take on extra responsibilities you must turn them down. You\u2019ll be the loser if you do not."}, {"text": "The tempo of life has picked up a lot over the past few days and it will get even faster over the coming weekend. The good news is you will enjoy the challenges that come your way as they give you a chance to prove yourself. And you will."}, {"text": "There will come a point today when you finally have enough of someone forcing you to do things you don\u2019t want to do and you hit back at them. Good for you. Do only what feels right to you and if they don\u2019t like it . . . too bad!"}, {"text": "The sun and Mars are very much on your side at the moment and endowing you with huge amounts of energy. Don\u2019t take on too many tasks though. It is quality work that will get you noticed, so do less but to a much higher standard."}, {"text": "Because you have built up a head of steam in recent weeks your momentum will carry you on for some time yet. It will, however, pay you to start looking at ways of decreasing your workload, maybe by not trying to do everything yourself!"}, {"text": "Mars in your birth sign makes you hugely ambitious and what you do today and over the weekend will amaze even those who thought they knew you well. Seize the initiative and make sure the world knows you are a force to be reckoned with."}, {"text": "Security in life is important, of course, but it should not be more important to you than freedom. The message of your birthday chart is that you need to let go of what appears to be holding you up \u2013 because in fact it is just holding you back."}, {"text": "You may have to dance to someone else\u2019s tune as the new week begins but you will still be generally free of restrictions and limitations. If others have power over you it can only be because you have given them that power \u2013 so take it back!"}, {"text": "It may seem to some people as if you are dreaming the impossible dream but they do not possess your level of self-belief. Whatever it is you want out of life you will find a way to get it, be it today, tomorrow or further into the future."}, {"text": "Try not to be too sensitive to criticism and steer clear of revealing your feelings, especially if they are negative in nature! Whatever happens over the next 24 hours, be it good, bad or indifferent, the important thing is that you deal with it calmly."}, {"text": "Loved ones will be rather demanding today and you may have to make sacrifices you don\u2019t want to make. Be that as it may you recognize that you have an obligation to assist them, so do so with good grace. One day they will return the favour."}, {"text": "Make sure those around you know how you feel today. Sometimes you can be a bit too self-controlled for your own good, and rather than suffer in silence it may pay you to kick up a bit of a fuss. But only a bit \u2013 don\u2019t overdo it!"}, {"text": "There is a danger now that you could go on a spending spree and buy things you cannot afford, and probably don\u2019t need to possess. For big purchases make sure you get some sort of money-back guarantee \u2013 you may have to use it quite quickly."}, {"text": "Put your own needs first as the new week begins and don\u2019t feel in the least bit guilty that you appear to be doing well while others are struggling. People never have been and never will be equal in their abilities. There will always be winners and losers."}, {"text": "Make sure you don\u2019t let your workload get on top of you this week. Draw up a schedule you know you can keep to and refuse to deviate from it, not even for people who promise you more money if you take on extra chores."}, {"text": "Someone you meet on your travels today could become a useful contact in the near future, so keep your eyes and ears open and don\u2019t ignore people just because they seem a bit \u201cdifferent\u201d in their ways. Think how you might look to them!"}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you look and act confident in all situations, because if your rivals get the idea that you are even a little bit anxious they will go out of their way to play on it. Pretend you don\u2019t have a care in the world."}, {"text": "Yes, your head is full of fantastic ideas but how many of them are ever going to see the light of day? Your main task now should be to focus on the two or three things that are likely to have the biggest impact. Ignore everything else."}, {"text": "Pluto\u2019s influence on your birthday is sure to make you more intense than usual, but maybe that\u2019s no bad thing. You\u2019ve been through your happy-go-lucky phase and now it\u2019s time to get passionate about what\u2019s important in life."}, {"text": "If you get involved in some kind of power struggle today most likely you will regret it. So much is going well for you now that you can afford to ignore what other people are saying about you, be it good or bad."}, {"text": "Chances are someone will try to annoy you today, most likely in the hope that you will overreact and do something silly. But you\u2019re too smart to fall for that kind of trick. Keep your temper under control and, above all, keep smiling."}, {"text": "The sun in Libra at this time of year is fortunate for you and there will be occasions when you wonder if you really deserve all the good things that are coming your way. Of course you do. In fact no one deserves them more."}, {"text": "You will find yourself in the kind of situation today where the odds are stacked heavily against you but no way are you going to back down. Don\u2019t make too much of an issue of it though. Be smart and live to fight another day."}, {"text": "If you compare yourself to other people you will always be dissatisfied with your lot, so focus on your own skills and talents and ignore what everyone else might be up to. Believe that life has purpose and meaning. You\u2019re doing better than most."}, {"text": "If certain facts and figures don\u2019t seem to add up today you must make it your responsibility to find out why. It could be there is a perfectly good explanation \u2013 or it could be someone is trying to cheat you. Either way, be careful."}, {"text": "This could be an emotional day for you, the kind of day when you are ridiculously happy one minute and angry for no good reason the next. Eventually your mood will settle down, but for now just sit back and ride it out!"}, {"text": "If your heart isn\u2019t in what others expect you to do then don\u2019t do it \u2013 yes, it\u2019s really that simple. What are they going to do? Force you? No one can compel a Scorpio to do things they don\u2019t want to do, not now, not ever!"}, {"text": "You may be a touch unhappy with your lot, but Pluto\u2019s influence warns this is probably not the best time to start making changes, not least because they could end up costing you a great deal more than you expected."}, {"text": "Pluto in your sign brings out the perfectionist in you but if you are wise you will accept that not even a Capricorn can get it right every day of the week. Don\u2019t set your standards too high \u2013 it might hurt when you fail to reach them."}, {"text": "How come you seem to be in the right place at the right time so much of late? Maybe it has something to do with the sun in the sympathetic sign of Libra. Whatever the reason, make the most if it \u2013 you know how fickle fate can be."}, {"text": "Few things in life come free of risk but that doesn\u2019t mean you should go looking for it. Try to steer clear of situations that could easily get out of hand \u2013 and the kind of people who enjoy making them get out of hand."}, {"text": "There is nothing wrong with your life but there may be something wrong with your attitude, and if you can change that then your fortunes will change for the better as well. Love. Laugh. Learn. Make those three little words your three guiding stars."}, {"text": "If someone betrays your trust this weekend don\u2019t let it make you cynical about life in general. Most people are still honest and trustworthy and would not dream of taking you for a ride. It\u2019s only the very few you have to watch out for."}, {"text": "You may be hurting on the inside, but on the outside try to make it look as if you don\u2019t have a care in the world. Put on a brave face, go out and have fun and before you know it your worries and woes will be in the past."}, {"text": "As far as a dispute of some kind is concerned, the facts of the situation are very much on your side and you won\u2019t find it hard to make your opponents look bad. But don\u2019t do it. Win, but win in as friendly a way as possible."}, {"text": "You will be rather assertive today and there is nothing wrong with that at all. However, you are strongly advised not to force others to do things they clearly don\u2019t want to do. Their feelings are as important to them as your success is to you."}, {"text": "The more others know about what you are planning the more likely it is they will oppose you in some, so don\u2019t give too much away today and certainly don\u2019t let them know that you may not be as confident as you look."}, {"text": "You need to sit down with someone and have a serious talk about your relationship. You have fallen out more than once in recent weeks and there is clearly something that needs to be dealt with. Approach the issue with mutual respect."}, {"text": "The way to turn your fortunes around is by letting important people know who you are and what you can do. What will really impress them though is your amazing attention to detail. That, plus devotion to duty, is a sure-fire recipe for success."}, {"text": "Whatever you do today someone is sure to criticize you for it, so you might as well close your ears and do it anyway. Fortunately, you are not the sort to let other people\u2019s disapproval affect you. In fact, you enjoy winding them up a bit."}, {"text": "You may think you can get away with outrageous behaviour but the planets warn you could easily push your luck too far and almost instantly regret it today. Keep your excesses at a reasonable level \u2013 reasonable by your standards anyway!"}, {"text": "The most important thing today is that you stick to the rules. If you stray from the straight and narrow even by the tiniest fraction the universe will punish you for it. You\u2019ve pushed your luck as far as it will go. Now get serious."}, {"text": "Co-operation is the key to success today. If you choose to go it alone you will get so far but no further as events conspire to limit your ability to get things done. You don\u2019t need all the credit for yourself \u2013 there is plenty to go around."}, {"text": "Try not to be so much of a perfectionist Pisces. Remind yourself at regular intervals that you are human like everyone else and like everyone else you make mistakes from time to time. Don\u2019t get into a habit of making them though!"}, {"text": "Your determination to succeed is admirable but you also need to know when it is time to back off and give yourself a breather. Not even a Libra can give 100 per cent every day of the year. Learn to be kind to yourself over the coming 12 months."}, {"text": "If you want people to understand what you are trying to say you will have to spell it out for them in words of three syllables or fewer. Not everyone is as sharp or as quick on the uptake as you \u2013 in fact hardly anyone is!"}, {"text": "Now that Pluto, planet of power, is moving in your favour again you won\u2019t be so reluctant to take on new responsibilities. But don\u2019t take on too many. Even a Taurus has limits and you are getting pretty close to yours already."}, {"text": "This will be one of those days when you want nothing more than to be left alone with your thoughts. If anyone is so silly as to invade your personal space they will soon learn the error of their ways. You\u2019re in no mood to be subtle."}, {"text": "It does not matter in the slightest if certain people are talking about you behind your back, there is nothing they can do to influence you. Cancer is a cardinal sign and once you have made up your mind about something that\u2019s it, it gets done."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s Mercury-Pluto link warns that people will tell you what they think you want to hear, and what will further their own interests. In which case, take everything you hear with a large pinch of salt \u2013 except when it\u2019s your inner voice talking."}, {"text": "There are so many distractions in your life and so many trivial things going on in the world. Your task today is to block it all out of your conscious mind and focus on your No. 1 aim. What matters to you is the only thing that matters."}, {"text": "Someone whose arrogance annoys you will give you a hard time today \u2013 and you must give them a hard time back. Sadly, the only language some people respect is the language of strength, so stand up for yourself, and maybe shout a bit too!"}, {"text": "There are some tasks that are too important to be left to other people and the task that is in front of you now is one of them. It may be tempting to sit back while others do the heavy lifting but that could be a huge mistake."}, {"text": "Yes, someone you are close to emotionally has betrayed your trust but don\u2019t let your disappointment show. This is one of those situations where, if you speak up, it could make the situation worse than before. Keep quiet and let it pass."}, {"text": "A little bit of mental effort on your part will go a long way toward convincing people in positions of power that you have what it takes to compete at the highest level. You\u2019re not just as good as your rivals, you\u2019re many times better!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t think about giving up on something that is proving a tough nut to crack. According to the planets you are very close to a breakthrough but if you give up now you will always wonder what might have been. Stick with it!"}, {"text": "What starts off as bad news early in the day will develop into good news later in the day, so don\u2019t get too dismayed by what you hear. They say every cloud has a silver lining and this particular cloud could be tinged with gold as well."}, {"text": "The most important thing for you over the coming year is that you stand up for yourself both in your private life and at work. Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good, so put your own needs first for a change. You\u2019ll feel better for it."}, {"text": "The people you have to deal with today, both at home and at work, will be rather demanding and there may be times when you come close to losing your temper. Maybe you should. Maybe that\u2019s what is needed to make them see sense."}, {"text": "There is really no such thing as coincidence in life and something that appears to be a random event today is actually part of a much bigger plan. Try to work out what that plan might be \u2013 it could make life so much easier to deal with."}, {"text": "This is a great time for creative activities and you must not let anyone tell you that what you are dreaming of cannot be done. That may be true for them but it is not true for you. Where Gemini is concerned not even the sky is the limit."}, {"text": "It may at times be hard to control your feelings but control them you must or you might say something you later regret. The sun in Libra at this time of year can make you rather emotional, so make allowances for other people, and for yourself."}, {"text": "This is both a busy and an enjoyable time for you but there is a danger that you could do too much and burn yourself out. You cannot party until the early hours then get up bright and fresh the next morning for work. Not every day anyway!"}, {"text": "This is an important time of year for money matters and business issues, and if you need to find ways to earn more or spend less \u2013 or maybe both \u2013 now is the time to put your thinking cap on and come up with some serious answers."}, {"text": "Things are going well for you at the moment but you are doing so many things on so many levels that you may wish that life was a bit more relaxed. A few weeks ago you were lamenting that life was too quiet. You\u2019re never satisfied Libra!"}, {"text": "There may be times when it feels as if the world is against you, but if you remain positive of mind and busy of body you will get through this phase unscathed. It\u2019s quite natural to feel low occasionally, so don\u2019t make a big issue of it."}, {"text": "You rarely lack for courage and confidence but you need to realize that those attributes alone won\u2019t get you where you need to go or get you what you want to possess. Common sense is a factor too. How much of that do you have?"}, {"text": "Career-wise so much is possible for you now, but a lot will depend on how well you can focus your power on a single target or goal. Don\u2019t scatter your energy and your thoughts in so many directions that you end up achieving nothing."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the sympathetic sign of Libra will give your confidence a boost today, not that you really need it! Be creative by all means but start thinking about your next vacation, too. Where might be nice at this time of year?"}, {"text": "You may be of the opinion that if you ignore a problem long enough it will go away of its own accord but that isn\u2019t going to happen, so wise up and do something specific that starts the process of change. It\u2019s up to you to make things happen."}, {"text": "Venus, your ruler, turns retrograde on your birthday this year, which suggests you need to start asking yourself some serious questions about your values. You also need to remind yourself at regular intervals that people are more important than things."}, {"text": "Why are people you don\u2019t always get along with so eager to get close to you now? Do they have a less-than-honest motive? Yes, most likely they do, so be on your guard and don\u2019t give away anything that might be of value to them."}, {"text": "If your inner voice warns that someone you have dealings with is not to be trusted you must pay attention. Even if you have successfully done business with them in the past that does not guarantee good relations now or in the future. Be worldly wise."}, {"text": "The more fantastic your ideas may be the more important it is to keep them to yourself. If your rivals get a hint of what you are thinking they may decide to steal your ideas and use them to enrich themselves\u2013 which may be unfair but isn\u2019t illegal."}, {"text": "If something you are involved with goes wrong today you must not blame yourself for it. It was a team effort and just as the team takes the applause when things go right so the team must face the consequences together when things go wrong."}, {"text": "The planets warn there is a danger that if you are too eager to hit back at your critics today you may encourage them to attack you all the more, setting off a tit-for-tat spiral that is unlikely to lead to anywhere good. Just let it go."}, {"text": "By all means give some serious thought to an idea that comes at you out of the blue today but don\u2019t start thinking it is the answer to all your prayers. At the very least you will have to work extra hard to get it up and running."}, {"text": "What occurs today is likely to come as a complete surprise to you but looking back at it a day or two from now you will realize you should have seen it coming. Next time, try looking at the whole picture rather than just the individual parts."}, {"text": "Let fate guide you and don\u2019t be surprised if it takes you some place that is a lot of fun. At this time of year more than most you seem to expect bad things to happen but it is always your mind that creates your world, so be positive!"}, {"text": "You may not think of yourself as an intuitive person but there is a part of your mind that knows all the answers and if you allow it to come through today you will discover some pretty amazing things. The world may not be what you think it is."}, {"text": "Something you thought had been forgotten will make a comeback today and no matter how uncomfortable it may be for you it must be faced up to. If you carry on pretending the issue does not exist it will carry on growing in importance."}, {"text": "It may be that someone has deceived you but even if they have it\u2019s unlikely it will do you much harm, so maybe you should just let it pass without mention \u2013 this time. If it happens again though you can and you must take decisive action."}, {"text": "There may be a dozen and one things going on in your world at the moment but don\u2019t start thinking you can ignore your responsibilities while you have fun. You also need to be aware that getting involved will cost you money \u2013 lots of money!"}, {"text": "If you listen to what others tell you this year all you will hear are reasons why you should do nothing. Ignore everyone else and listen to what your own heart says. Yes it does speak, and it knows what you need to do. So do it!"}, {"text": "As the first and most dynamic sign of the zodiac you often get your way through sheer force of personality, but the planets warn you will need to take a more subtle approach this weekend. If you don\u2019t know the meaning of the word then look it up!"}, {"text": "Not everyone is as honest as you Taurus and if you keep that fact in mind today you should do okay. You are certainly less likely to be cheated by people who measure their own success by what they can steal from others. Yes, they do exist."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of power will make what looks like a pretty good offer this weekend but you should think long and hard before you accept it. Are there any hidden costs you will have to incur? Find out before you sign up."}, {"text": "A somewhat negative link between the sun and Neptune warns that your imagination could play tricks on you over the next 48 hours. By all means visualize the life you would like to be living in the future but steer clear of fantasies."}, {"text": "Being the sort of person who speaks first and only thinks about what you have said later on \u2013 if at all \u2013 it\u2019s quite likely you will say something this weekend that upsets a friend. If they get angry just say \u201csorry\u201d. No lasting harm will be done."}, {"text": "You may say or do something that a loved one takes the wrong way this weekend, but chances are you will be completely oblivious to the fact. If they start acting strangely make it your business to find out what\u2019s up with them \u2013 it may be you!"}, {"text": "A tactic that worked well for you in the past is unlikely to work quite so well this weekend, so be prepared to take a different approach if the situation calls for it. And remember, the best tactic of all is to be honest with everyone."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t push yourself too hard this weekend. The sun in the most sensitive area of your chart, at odds with Neptune, means you may be a bit vague about what it is you should be doing \u2013 in which case it might be safer to do nothing at all."}, {"text": "No matter how easygoing you are most of the time you won\u2019t be able to keep your feelings under wraps today and tomorrow. Find a constructive outlet for your more negative emotions \u2013 sport and other physical activities could help you immensely."}, {"text": "Why do you think you have something to prove? Why do you think you need to be bigger and better than everyone else? Whatever the reason it will pay you to calm down and take life at a more relaxed pace this weekend. Don\u2019t bust a gut!"}, {"text": "The sun in Libra gives you loads of energy and you should be using it to finish at least some of those tasks you started earlier in the year but never got round to completing. Don\u2019t overdo it though \u2013 give yourself time to daydream as well."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try to force people to do things against their will, because your efforts are sure to backfire. The only way to get what you want is to make sure that your desires match up with the desires of friends and family. Work together towards a single aim."}, {"text": "A sun-Saturn link on your birthday means you will have to work extra hard to reach your goals. It also means that when you get to the place you\u2019ve been aiming for the sense of satisfaction you feel will be tremendous. It\u2019s an effort worth making."}, {"text": "You may not be interested in a social activity of some kind but the planets suggest if you take the plunge you will enjoy yourself. Just take care you don\u2019t enjoy yourself too much \u2013 this is one of those days when you could go to extremes."}, {"text": "A friend or work colleague will make something that is actually quite risky sound like the simplest thing in the world today. Don\u2019t be fooled. If they ask you to invest your time and money in the project be polite but give it a miss."}, {"text": "You seem to be a bit too assertive, even aggressive, at the moment, and that could work against you if you offend someone who is big enough to hit back hard. If you can be a little less abrasive today you will get a lot more done."}, {"text": "You are not the type to sit on the fence and watch the world go by \u2013 as a cardinal sign you prefer to get involved. Which is fine, but the planets warn if you get too deeply involved in someone else\u2019s business today you may never get out again!"}, {"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t shoot the messenger\u201d appears to be the warning from the stars today Leo. If a friend or family member says something you don\u2019t like it\u2019s not because they want to hurt you, it\u2019s because they feel they have no choice in the matter."}, {"text": "By all means be ambitious but try not to be impulsive. More than anything else now you must be 100 per cent convinced that the course of action you are about to take is really for the best. Always have a purpose, and always have a plan."}, {"text": "Your calm Libra exterior is likely to crack a bit as someone annoys you to such an extent that you can\u2019t help but let your feelings show. Hopefully they are smart enough to get the message. If not, it could get a bit nasty by day\u2019s end."}, {"text": "If you try to force people to do things they don\u2019t want to do today you are asking for trouble \u2013 and you\u2019ll get it big time. Scorpio may be a persuasive sign but sometimes you have to accept that no matter what you offer it won\u2019t be enough."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Saturn link could make you a bit reticent today, a bit reluctant to take risks. That may seem out of character but it could also save you from making a huge mistake. Listen to what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you."}, {"text": "No one is out to get you. No one is scheming behind your back. Although your ruling planet Saturn is under a bit of pressure at the moment that does not mean you should fear the worst. In fact, fearing it is more likely to make it happen."}, {"text": "Try not to take what happens over the next 24 hours too seriously because the planets indicate that nothing bad will come of it \u2013 at least, nothing bad for you personally. Also, what happens in the world at large must not be allowed to affect your mood."}, {"text": "It may be frustrating that someone is dragging their feet and refusing to move as quickly as you would like them to but there is precious little you can do about it. Do what you can to hurry them along but don\u2019t get angry or upset. It\u2019s not worth it."}, {"text": "The message of your birthday chart this year is that you should throw yourself into social activities and not worry too much about more \u201cserious\u201d matters. They may be a big deal for you now but new friendships will make them look small."}, {"text": "You may think that giving up on something is the only course of action left open to you, but it isn\u2019t true. The approaching new moon means it might be wise to wait a while. Chances are you will be thinking more clearly come this time tomorrow."}, {"text": "Can you trust what other people tell you? Probably not. The planets warn that even partners and loved ones are giving you bad information. They may not be doing it on purpose, of course, but you still need to err on the side of caution."}, {"text": "Once again you seem to be worrying about something that you have no way of changing \u2013 which is pointless. Fate will guide you in whatever direction you are destined to take, so stop worrying, sit back and enjoy the ride. It WILL be fun!"}, {"text": "Deep down you know that money and possessions are of little worth, but you still need to put food on the table and that means you must get your financial act together as soon as possible. Get loved ones to help you \u2013 they will if you ask."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to get involved in a friend\u2019s domestic situation today but the planets warn that nothing good will come of it, so keep your distance. The best way to help them is to let them learn from their own mistakes and experiences."}, {"text": "You have noticed a distinct difference in the direction your life seems to be taking in recent weeks. Don\u2019t fight it. Life moves in cycles and no part of the cycle is better or worse than the part that went before. Live in and for the moment."}, {"text": "There is an urgency about you now that was lacking earlier in the year and it will grow even stronger when the moon is new in your sign tomorrow. But don\u2019t let your desire to get things done cloud your judgment. Avoid making silly mistakes."}, {"text": "If you play hard to get over the next 24 hours you will send just about everyone you know the wrong kind of signal. Make an effort to show people, especially those in positions of power, that you are still in the game and still hungry for success."}, {"text": "By all means plan something new but don\u2019t start on it just yet. Tomorrow\u2019s new moon will bring to light information that could see you changing your plans, to your benefit, at the last possible moment, so the less you do today the better."}, {"text": "It\u2019s good that you have the confidence to take risks but that does not mean you should start taking them wildly. Tomorrow\u2019s new moon in the career area of your chart, the effects of which you will start feeling today, will point you in the right direction."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to end a partnership or relationship that has been nothing but trouble of late but is that such a wise move? Give it a day or two before you say or do anything you might later regret. Maybe it\u2019s still worth keeping alive."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you don\u2019t let vague fears and forebodings hold you back from doing what you want to do. Is this the only life we live? Who knows, but act as if it is. Don\u2019t let today, or any other day, go to waste."}, {"text": "A new moon on your birthday makes this the perfect day to start a new project or even a whole new way of life. If there is something you have dreamed of doing for months or even years then do it now. Just act and let the universe guide you."}, {"text": "Jupiter in the wealth area of your chart means there is every chance you will come into money, but there is also a chance that you will lose what you gain by wasting it buying things for people who are too cheap to pay for themselves. Wise up!"}, {"text": "Someone you work with will offer you some excellent advice today but because it is not what you were hoping to hear you may be tempted to ignore it. That would be a serious mistake. Don\u2019t let your ego blind you to reality."}, {"text": "A new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart means you will be tempted to go faster than ever today, but as you are racing ahead at top speed already that could be a dangerous thing to do. Try moving at a more sensible pace."}, {"text": "Anything is possible for you now but that does not mean you should try to do everything. If you want to get the most from the next few days you must focus your energy in a single direction and put secondary interests on hold for a while."}, {"text": "Why are you attaching so much importance to things that only a few days ago would have meant nothing to you at all? Whatever the reason you need to get over it, and quickly. Attitude is everything, so start thinking and acting in more positive ways."}, {"text": "You may be eager to start something new and you know it could be a big success, but can you afford to take on such a costly commitment? You don\u2019t have to give up on your dream but you do have to bring it down to earth a little."}, {"text": "A lot of good things are coming your way and today\u2019s new moon in your sign is sure to bring something, or someone, into your life that makes you believe the good times will never end. They must, one day, of course, but for now just enjoy!"}, {"text": "Jupiter in your sign endows you with a surplus of optimism and self-belief and if you are smart you will spread some of it around to people who don\u2019t possess your amazingly positive outlook on life. Remember, what you give you get back tenfold."}, {"text": "A good deed you did for a friend will be paid back in full today, with a little extra added as a \u201cthank you\u201d from the universe. If you get out into the world and meet new people there will be many more days like this in the future."}, {"text": "Be careful what you choose to believe today because there are a lot of strange ideas doing the rounds at the moment. Yes, sometimes there really are plots and conspiracies to watch out for, but don\u2019t start believing that everyone is out to get you!"}, {"text": "The sun in Libra is an excellent influence for you and today\u2019s new moon will be the cosmic icing on the cake. Self-belief is a wonderful thing and you have so much of it now that almost anything is possible. Note that word \u201calmost\u201d though!"}, {"text": "It\u2019s not often you take silly risks but you could do so today, and if there is money involved you could end up making the kind of loss you cannot afford. Stick with what you\u2019ve got and be happy with that. You\u2019re still doing better than most."}, {"text": "A Mercury-Uranus link on your birthday suggests you will be looking for new ways to improve your lifestyle and some of the ideas you come up with may be rather exotic. Go for it though. If anyone can make the unusual work, you can!"}, {"text": "It may seem as if you don\u2019t have a care in the world but you can at times be extremely sensitive and you may find it hard to hide that side of your nature today. But why on earth would you want to? Never be scared of your feelings."}, {"text": "Forget about doing the right thing \u2013 do what feels right for you. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Scorpio suggests others will try to get you to see and do things their way but you are under no obligation. Be true to yourself."}, {"text": "You need to let certain individuals know that you have no intention of putting up with their negative remarks. You have serious things to do and you cannot afford to waste time on those who always seem to see the worst in the world."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to turn down a social invitation today but the planets warn that might be a mistake. Someone you meet on your travels could turn out to be very useful to you over the next few months. Enjoy meeting people, even when you don\u2019t!"}, {"text": "According to the planets you may be feeling guilty because things are going well for you but badly for someone you know. There\u2019s really no need. What\u2019s happening to them is designed by the universe to help them grow. Ultimately, it\u2019s all good."}, {"text": "As Mercury, your ruler, moves into the area of your chart associated with how you think and how you communicate, you won\u2019t have just one good idea, you\u2019ll have dozens! Make a list of them but don\u2019t try to do them all at the same time!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if your cash-flow situation is not as healthy as you would like it to be. Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, has moved into the money area of your chart you can find ways to make ends meet again, and maybe even turn a profit!"}, {"text": "Jupiter in your sign gives you no end of confidence and with mind planet Mercury moving in your favour, to, few things will faze you today. If you feel the need to satisfy your material desires, do so without feeling guilty about it."}, {"text": "Sooner or later you are going to have to make some major changes to your lifestyle but don\u2019t get impatient and start before the time is right. When will that be? Listen to your inner voice and move swiftly and decisively when it tells you to act."}, {"text": "What happens today will in some way remind you that making money and climbing the ladder of success, while enjoyable, are not really what life is about. It\u2019s people that matter, not things or possessions. You\u2019re rich in friendships, so enjoy them."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign makes you intensely ambitious but other influences warn that you need to keep your professional life and your private life in balance. On the home front, especially, you must spend more time with the people who love you."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to get your own back on someone who has let you down or made you look silly, but is it worth the effort? Probably not. You\u2019ve got more productive things to do with your time than pursue senseless vendettas."}, {"text": "The planets warn that with so many amazing plans in your mind you run the risk of spreading yourself too thin. You have only so much time and energy to spare, so be selective and only do what really matters in the present moment."}, {"text": "Why have you retreated into your shell? It\u2019s not like you to shut yourself off from the world and if you refuse to get out and about and interact with friends and family they may start to worry about you. Let them know you\u2019re okay."}, {"text": "You could make an issue of something that annoys you but is it worth the effort? No, it\u2019s not. There are so many things going well for you now that minor setbacks can be safely ignored. Don\u2019t waste your time on people who think and act small."}, {"text": "Something that once seemed beyond you is now within your grasp and at some stage today you must reach out and take it. But don\u2019t hold on to it too tightly. The less possessive you are about material things the more of them you will enjoy."}, {"text": "If a friend or family member is sending out signals that they don\u2019t want you to get too close you must respect their wishes. You may not understand why they are refusing to accept your help but there will be a reason, so keep your distance."}, {"text": "Someone you have not seen for a while will come back into your life over the next few days. Whatever your relationship was like before it will be all smiles now as you remember all the good times you shared \u2013 while conveniently forgetting the bad!"}, {"text": "Try not to pay too much attention to matters of a material nature. Your financial status is of no great importance in the wider scheme of things, so put all thoughts of money out of your head and focus on creativity \u2013 and love what you are doing."}, {"text": "You may be of the opinion that the best way to proceed is to tear down everything you have built and start again from scratch, but is that really necessary? Today\u2019s Venus-Mars link warns against impetuous action. Think before you make your move."}, {"text": "Even a Scorpio gets it wrong once in a while, so don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal just because you made a mistake of some kind. At the very least the situation should remind you that you are only human, just like everyone else."}, {"text": "You cannot live in fear of things that might happen in the future but most likely won\u2019t. The world is full of people who spread doom and gloom news but you don\u2019t have to be one of them. Be positive today and help others be positive too."}, {"text": "Work and career issues are going well for you now but don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that you no longer have to make as much effort as you did before. You are only as good as your last success, so keep at it and keep making waves."}, {"text": "The more certain people complain that you are making life difficult for them the more you can be sure that you are on the right track. The fact is your needs and their needs are at right angles to each other, so make sure your needs come first."}, {"text": "If you have feelings for someone but they don\u2019t know about it you may be tempted to open up and tell them today. That might be a mistake. Today\u2019s Venus-Mars link suggests the response you get may not be to your liking. Leave it a while."}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link on your birthday means there will be some pretty stiff challenges over the coming 12 months, but if you are going to accomplish anything meaningful in life you must embrace those challenges rather than try to avoid them. Be the best!"}, {"text": "The more you try to convince people that you know what is best for them the more inclined they are to disbelieve you, which is annoying to say the least. Maybe you should take the hint and let them sort it out for themselves."}, {"text": "No matter how much work has piled up over the past few days you must forget about it for now and plan for the weekend. Ignore existing deadlines, at least for the next 72 hours. Your work will still be there for you come Monday morning."}, {"text": "You could not care less what other people think about your methods and you will make sure they know that fact today. But don\u2019t come on too strong and antagonize people you will need to get along with over the next few weeks. Be tactful."}, {"text": "You may find it harder than usual to control your temper today, due to the influence of a tough looking sun-Pluto link, but if you put your mind to it you can find ways to stay calm. Nothing in life is worth getting too worked up about."}, {"text": "Last minute changes to travel and social plans are best avoided, not least because your workload is such that it will be hard enough to meet your commitments as it is, without adding uncertainty to the mix. Stick to what you have already agreed on."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t plan on getting ahead of yourself today because the planets warn you will be called on to deal with unexpected crises both at home and at work and they will eat into your time. Take events as they come and take nothing too seriously."}, {"text": "There may be one or two emotionally bruising encounters today with people whose way of looking at the world is very different to your own. Try not to make a war of it but don\u2019t back down either. You must always stick up for yourself."}, {"text": "Little things will annoy you today and the more you tell yourself to stop being silly and get on with life the more worked up you will get. By this time tomorrow you will have calmed down again. Hopefully not much damage will have been done!"}, {"text": "You hate injustice but you sometimes see bad things occurring where they don\u2019t really exist and that could be a problem for you over the next 24 hours. Keep telling yourself that it will all come right in the end \u2013 the universe will see to it."}, {"text": "Be flexible today. Bend a little. Yes, of course you can do that Capricorn! People in positions of authority are watching you closely and if they like what they see it could be rewarding for you in the very near future. Never be too rigid in your thinking."}, {"text": "Sometimes you read too much into what is taking place in the world and that could be a problem today as the sun\u2019s link to Pluto, planet of power, encourages you to expect the worst. No, it\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s just the beginning."}, {"text": "Sometimes it\u2019s okay to be a bit suspicious and today\u2019s less than positive cosmic alignment will make it easy to believe that certain individuals cannot be trusted. Keep your doubts to yourself for the time being but be on your guard as well."}, {"text": "Take time on your birthday to define your goals for the coming year. You don\u2019t need to go into detail but you do need to identify the direction you want to move in and the milestones you want to reach along the way. Give yourself something to aim for."}, {"text": "Your self-confidence could be a bit fragile this weekend as nothing you do seems to find favour with people you love and respect. Don\u2019t worry, this is only a passing phase, so let it pass and come Monday you will be their favourite again."}, {"text": "Ignore those who say that certain things must not be said or done. If a belief or course of action feels right to you then go for it. Pay no attention to what others tell you this weekend. Only listen to and act on what your inner voice says."}, {"text": "If you give others the impression that you are being too negative about what they are proposing they may cut you out of their plans, and that would be a shame because the planets indicate they will be a huge success. Be positive Gemini!"}, {"text": "Someone you can usually trust seems to be giving you a slanted version of what\u2019s been going on and you must make it your number one aim to find out the truth. If you act on misleading information the consequences could be disastrous."}, {"text": "The effects of yesterday\u2019s sun-Pluto link won\u2019t fade for a day or two yet, so be careful what you say to people in positions of power and don\u2019t be tempted to use your own position to get an advantage over others. If you do it WILL rebound on you."}, {"text": "Why are some people so negative in their thinking? Whatever the reason you must have no part of it and may even have to distance yourself physically this weekend so their bad vibes can\u2019t rub off on you. Always believe that good things will happen."}, {"text": "This could turn out to be one of those weekends when the more you strive to get things done the less you seem to accomplish. Maybe you should take the hint and stop trying so hard. The workday week is over, so why not have some fun?"}, {"text": "If you change something you are working on in even a minor way the long-term effects are unlikely to be to your liking, so think before you act and recognize that, in fact, you are under no obligation to act at all. Don\u2019t make life difficult for yourself."}, {"text": "Yes, it may be true that someone is talking behind your back \u2013 you\u2019ve heard the whispers \u2013 but there is nothing you can do about it, so why let it get to you? Most likely they are jealous of your talent and good looks. Most people are!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t wait for a friend to ask for assistance today \u2013 you can see they are struggling and you must dive right in and help. But don\u2019t go too far and completely take over what they are doing. Just show them how to do it better for themselves."}, {"text": "The planets suggest you are worrying about something that isn\u2019t worth the effort, so get your head together and tell yourself that from here on in you are not even going to think about it. This kind of \u201cproblem\u201d tends to go away if you ignore it."}, {"text": "You need to be a bit more skeptical about what friends tell you and what you read and hear in the news. That is doubly important when the news is negative. Are things really so bad or are certain people putting a slant on events for their own ends?"}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link on your birthday will stir things up over the coming 12 months but if you can stay calm and identify the new opportunities that are sure to arise you will not only survive but thrive as well. Most change is good change, so don\u2019t fight it."}, {"text": "A sun-Pluto link warns of upheavals and confrontations. That\u2019s probably not what you want to hear right at the start of the week but forewarned is forearmed and now you know there is trouble afoot you can make some nimble moves to avoid it."}, {"text": "You will be faced with a situation that calls for quick and decisive action today. It will be obvious right from the start that this is not the sort of situation you can avoid, so accept the position you find yourself in and turn it to your advantage."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be content to sit back and watch the world go by over the next few days \u2013 you will be eager to get out there and do things that make a difference. Make sure it\u2019s a positive difference though, not just something you do for fun."}, {"text": "You have no intention of doing what other people tell you to do, especially if they seem to believe that their elevated social or professional position gives them the right to direct your actions. It doesn\u2019t, and the sooner they learn that fact the better."}, {"text": "Even if you may not believe that one individual can change the world you are advised to act as if you believe it today. With the sun, your ruler, linked to power planet Pluto you must not be scared to rock the boat. Create your own little storm."}, {"text": "Before you do something big, maybe even spectacular, think carefully about how much it is going to cost you, because the planets warn you could easily let your spending get out of hand. Decide on a reasonable budget and stick to it Virgo."}, {"text": "There will be some interesting developments in your social life this week and, yes, you will have one, even though you seem to be working all hours at the moment. There is more to life than making a living, so get out there and, well, live a little."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in and around the most sensitive area of your chart has got you jumping at shadows of late and today\u2019s sun-Pluto link won\u2019t help much. But that\u2019s okay. A good scare could be precisely what you need to get you moving again."}, {"text": "Accept from the start this week that other people will not be playing by the rules. That will put you in the right frame of mind to deal with whatever challenges come your way. Remember, all is fair in love and war \u2013 and making money and getting ahead."}, {"text": "You need to do something different, something that helps you break through the limitations that have been imposed on you (and which you have imposed on yourself) in recent weeks. If you make it something big and bold the world is sure to take notice."}, {"text": "You tend to take certain things for granted and act as if they will never change, but today\u2019s sun-Pluto link will destroy that belief quite forcefully. The simple fact is that nothing stays the same forever \u2013 and nor should you want it to."}, {"text": "The going will get a bit rough over the next day or two and you may need to get assistance from someone you know you can trust. Likewise, others will come to you for help in their moments of need. Kindness and co-operation are what life\u2019s all about."}, {"text": "Money matters should go well for you over the next 12 months. You don\u2019t have to do anything special to attract financial good fortune \u2013 just expect good things to become available to you and, somehow, they will materialize in your life. Lucky you."}, {"text": "Your feelings for a certain person run deep and with love planet Venus so strong in your chart they will get deeper still over the next few days. By all means worship the ground they walk on but don\u2019t forget they are human too."}, {"text": "Love is in the air as the new week begins. Too often of late you have allowed affairs of the heart to take a back seat while you took care of business but that must now end. Give your attention to the people who matter \u2013 the people you love."}, {"text": "If you want to get on in the world then you are going to have to be a bit more flexible in the way you approach work matters. You cannot expect others to change their ways just to suit you, at least not every time, so bend a little, too."}, {"text": "This could be one of those days when everything you desire will just fall into your lap. Yes, it really should be that good. A lot depends, of course, on your attitude. If you expect good things to happen they most likely will."}, {"text": "You may not be modest by nature but it will pay you to let others take some of the credit for recent successes. If you say nice things about the people you work with now chances are they won\u2019t be so demanding of you later on."}, {"text": "Spend time with those you feel attuned to emotionally and avoid those whose very presence annoys or upsets you. You are not wrong to have these feelings \u2013 deep down you can sense that being close to them could be bad for your health."}, {"text": "You seem to believe that someone is hiding something from you. Maybe they are but that does not mean it\u2019s a bad thing. Most likely they want to surprise you in some way, so don\u2019t ask too many questions \u2013 you don\u2019t want to spoil it!"}, {"text": "Venus and Mercury join forces in your sign today, making this one of the best times ever to let the people you love know how you feel about them. You certainly seem to be flavour of the month at the moment. Make it last as long as you can!"}, {"text": "The last few days have been rather intense and you\u2019ve hardly had time to catch your breath, but now you can sit back and let life come to you. Don\u2019t worry about tomorrow, nor the day after that. Your guardian angel is watching over you."}, {"text": "This is one of those days when you will find yourself on exactly the same wavelength as the people around you, which is nice. Everyone seems amazingly friendly now but don\u2019t let that make you suspicious. There\u2019s no trickery or deception involved."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart suggests that employers and other important people will look on you favourably over the next 24 hours. Whatever favours you ask of them they will do their best to grant, so ask away!"}, {"text": "No matter where you go or what you do today the universe will take care of you, so stop worrying about what your next step should be and just take it. Travel plans are under excellent stars and the further afield you go the more fun you will have."}, {"text": "The year ahead of you is going to be life-changing, and it won\u2019t only be your life that changes. The challenges you face must be faced alongside those who share your higher values. Don\u2019t go it alone and certainly don\u2019t lower your standards."}, {"text": "Sometimes you can be too suspicious for your own good but it\u2019s quite unnecessary at the moment because it\u2019s obvious who your real enemies are. All you have to do is decide whether to confront them or whether to avoid them."}, {"text": "There is a great deal taking place behind the scenes at the moment, so don\u2019t jump to conclusions and don\u2019t make any major moves that don\u2019t have to be made. What\u2019s going on will be a lot clearer toward the end of the week."}, {"text": "A friend is not really a friend and an enemy is not really an enemy. How did you get them mixed up? Whatever the reason you know what is what and who is who now, so get your act together and put things right. Better late than never."}, {"text": "The more you try to move ahead with a plan that means a lot to you the more invisible forces seem to be holding you back. Perhaps you should take the hint and recognize that the universe does not want you to go down this particular route."}, {"text": "It always seems to others as if you have total self-belief but there are times when even a Leo starts to have doubts and this appears to be one of them. Maybe if you stopped chasing after things you clearly cannot have life would be happier."}, {"text": "There is a simple solution to your current dilemma and it won\u2019t be long before you recognize what it is and what needs to be done to get past it. You may have to make do with less for a while but you\u2019ll make up for it later."}, {"text": "You must not try to avoid relationship problems, especially those that have been dragging on for a while. If a difference of opinion is so glaringly obvious that it cannot be ignored then you must do something about it \u2013 and that means today!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste time and energy trying to explain to other people why you had to do certain things because if they don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d by now chances are they never will. Just do what you feel is right and be ready to live with the consequences."}, {"text": "If you are not happy with either a relationship or something of a creative nature then you must change it. Don\u2019t let it carry on as it is because that just guarantees you will become even more disillusioned. Take action and take it right now."}, {"text": "You may want to rush in and get things done today but that little voice in the back of your head is urging caution and you would be wise to listen to it. The planets warn if you act in haste you could soon come to a grinding halt."}, {"text": "People will ask you what you think about certain situations today and being the brutally honest kind of person you are you will tell them \u2013 and they won\u2019t like it. Be that as it may it is your cosmic duty to call it as you see it."}, {"text": "Try not to be greedy today when it comes to money matters and possessions. It\u2019s fine that material things mean a lot to you but that can make it easier for rivals and enemies to pull your strings. Pretend you don\u2019t care about material things."}, {"text": "You must not take \u201cNo\u201d for an answer, not in your personal life and not in your working life. If you want to be taken seriously \u2013 and you do \u2013 then you must show that you are not the sort who gives up in the face of opposition."}, {"text": "You will get an interesting offer of some kind over the next 24 hours and, yes, it will be a genuine offer. Deep down you know this is the kind of golden opportunity you cannot allow to pass, so take advantage of the situation \u2013 quickly!"}, {"text": "Not everyone will approve of what you get up to today but that won\u2019t worry you in the slightest. Sometimes you quite enjoy stirring things up a little, or a lot, so push ahead with your plans and, if others don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s good!"}, {"text": "The sun in the most dynamic area of your chart puts you in the mood to change things around. However, other aspects warn there are some things it might be wiser to leave as they are. Change things for a reason, not just because you can."}, {"text": "You will reach your objectives in life a lot quicker if you join hands with people who share your aims and ambitions and, more importantly, your principles and beliefs. On your own, you can do only so much. Together, you can do everything."}, {"text": "Decide what it is you want to achieve then set about it with energy, enthusiasm and a passion for excellence. No matter how many disappointments you may have suffered in the past your future looks bright, so get your act together \u2013 and get busy."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your time and energy trying to settle old scores. Be positive about your ambitions, and be forgiving of people who, for one reason or another, cannot reach your high standards. There has rarely been a better time for a Virgo to shine."}, {"text": "If you know what you want and if you are bold enough to go after it you will accomplish great things. Someone in a position of authority will look kindly on you today and you must use their influence to help get what you want."}, {"text": "Although you have been under a lot of pressure in recent weeks you must also admit that you have learned a great deal about both yourself and other people. Sometimes it takes tough times to discover who we are and what we can do."}, {"text": "Instead of brooding on how unfair the world is why don\u2019t you get out there and do something to improve it? If you are tired of seeing the same negative stories in the media every day then write a more positive one for yourself."}, {"text": "This could be and should be a day to remember for all the right reasons. Don\u2019t let self-doubt hold you back. Both in your personal life and at work anything and everything is possible. Nourish your belief in yourself \u2013 and watch it grow."}, {"text": "The planets indicate you need to get yourself into a frame of mind where nothing bothers you too much, where you can accept what happens in the world around you with serenity. For starters, don\u2019t take anyone or anything too seriously today."}, {"text": "Speak up and let people know what you believe and why you believe it. Too often in the past you have been too negative about your own ideas and opinions, and that must now change. Let the world know you have something to say."}, {"text": "You will be so full of energy and enthusiasm this year that you take on tasks you previously believed would be too much for you. That\u2019s great but you still need to be selective. Do one thing really well rather than several things to a lower standard."}, {"text": "You may go over the top in some way today but chances are the universe will protect you. That is not, of course, an excuse to act in ways that might hurt other people, not least because that hurt is sure to come back at you at some stage."}, {"text": "If something does not work out the way you expected it to today don\u2019t feel bad about it, and certainly don\u2019t try to make others feel bad by pinning the blame on them. Life is full of ups and downs. You\u2019ll feel better about the situation tomorrow."}, {"text": "You may not want to let others make decisions for you on the work front but you must let them take some of the strain. Jupiter, planet of excess, is encouraging you to push yourself harder than ever, but that may not be good for your health."}, {"text": "Why are you trying so hard to impress other people when, if anything, they should be trying to impress you? Focus on what you do well today and give it 100 per cent. If others praise you for it that\u2019s great; if not, that\u2019s okay, too."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, force people you work with to do your bidding today but why would you want to when they are more than willing to assist if you just ask them nicely? Get rid of the tough guy act \u2013 you don\u2019t need it."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t try to avoid situations that have the potential to turn nasty \u2013 tackle them head on. The planets suggest you will quite enjoy getting stuck in to situations that most other people would prefer to avoid. It\u2019s the challenge that excites you."}, {"text": "You will get a chance to do something remarkable today and you must not let it pass you by. Don\u2019t sit at home wondering what is going on in the world outside your door \u2013 get out there and find out. And then add your bit as well."}, {"text": "Most likely you will be in the mood to sit back and watch the world go by today, and so you should. You will be busier than ever not long after the sun enters your sign on the 23rd, so why put yourself under pressure now?"}, {"text": "There has rarely been a better time to push yourself forward and show those around you, at home and at work, what you are capable of. Be assertive but in a way that does not antagonize people. Even if you\u2019re the boss you should also be a friend."}, {"text": "You are not really as conservative in your thinking as you sometimes make out and over the next two or three days you will get the opportunity to surprise people by the radical nature of your ideas. They must, of course, be practical too."}, {"text": "The world seems such a sunny and happy place at the moment \u2013 for you at least \u2013 and you must strive to make your positive outlook last as long as possible. Don\u2019t strive too hard though as that could stress you out all over again!"}, {"text": "Upcoming cosmic influences will boost both your ego and your energy. On the work front, especially, you will no longer be prepared to play second fiddle to people whose talents you don\u2019t rate as highly as your own. You know you\u2019re the best."}, {"text": "The influence of Mercury on your birthday this year means you will have plenty to say for yourself, and most of it will be worth hearing, but you also need to make sure that you deal only in facts. Don\u2019t give your rivals a chance to make you look bad."}, {"text": "Certain people may be disruptive and hard to get along with today but don\u2019t worry about it too much. Listen to what they have to say and promise to take their ideas into consideration, then do what you were going to do anyway."}, {"text": "There are so many cosmic forces battering you at the moment that you have no choice but to let them get on with it. Things will improve dramatically tomorrow and even more so early next week. Better times are coming \u2013 look forward to them."}, {"text": "This may be a rather tense time for you but if you keep telling yourself that there is nothing to worry about your belief in that opinion will make it a fact. Never underestimate the power of the mind, especially the Gemini mind!"}, {"text": "It may seem as if the world has gone crazy but are things really as bad as some people say? No, of course not. In fact there are still plenty of things going on, many in your own immediate environment, that can cheer you up if you let them."}, {"text": "Everything has its time and place and when one thing moves out of your life another soon comes in to replace it. With that thought in mind don\u2019t try to cling to something that is now on its way out. Its time is over. Your time is just beginning."}, {"text": "No doubt you have big plans for the remainder of the year and no doubt you have made all sorts of promises to yourself that this time you will get it right. That\u2019s great but don\u2019t look too far ahead. Take each day as it comes."}, {"text": "What seems such a trivial issue to you is obviously of major importance to other people, so don\u2019t try to ignore it because they simply won\u2019t let you. At least make it look as if you share their concerns, even if you couldn\u2019t care less."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s Mars-Mercury link warns you need to watch what you say. If you come on too strong you could find that you spark a fight or feud that causes all sides some serious damage. You don\u2019t have to tell it like it is all the time Scorpio!"}, {"text": "If you go out of your way to help other people today they will go out of their way to help you later on, so everybody wins. Besides which, it does your soul good to assist a fellow human being when they can\u2019t do certain things for themselves."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that if you want to stay happy \u2013 indeed, if you want to stay sane \u2013 you need to go with the flow and trust that in time what seems to be going wrong now will set itself right. The universe has a way of balancing things out."}, {"text": "Why so jumpy? Why so afraid? Whatever the reason you must get over it because in a matter of days there will be an opportunity to move up in your job or career and to make the most of that opportunity you will need to be bold."}, {"text": "You have never been much for routine but you dislike it when other people change their routines and leave you high and dry. Maybe that\u2019s what you get for relying too much on friends and colleagues. Maybe you should set your own agenda."}, {"text": "There is one thing and one thing only that can stop you from reaching the heights and that is your own negative thinking. Promise yourself on your birthday this year that you will greet each new day with a smile and each new challenge with genuine enthusiasm."}, {"text": "A relationship of some kind will come under pressure this weekend and if you say the wrong thing at the wrong time in the wrong way it could end completely. Try to keep your more negative thoughts to yourself. You don\u2019t have to speak up."}, {"text": "You seem to have hit a wall as far as a creative project is concerned. Do you carry on with it? Or do you give up and focus your energy in a new direction? It would be a shame to waste all the time you have invested. Give it another go."}, {"text": "Your workload will increase dramatically a few days from now, so make sure you are on top of your chores or you could be playing catch-up for several weeks to come. Better still, delegate as much as you can to other people."}, {"text": "A feud that has dragged on for ages needs to be resolved, and quickly. If you allow it to linger it could hold you back from doing something creative with your life when the sun moves in your favour on Tuesday. Look for a compromise solution."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t feel like doing much this weekend then . . . don\u2019t do it. Your mind and your body have been sending you signals for quite some time now that you need to take things easy \u2013 and it\u2019s about time you listened to them."}, {"text": "Why are you still waiting? Why are you still hesitating? Whatever the reason you need to get over it because new opportunities will be coming your way very soon and you must be in the kind of mindset where you can move quickly."}, {"text": "Once again you seem to be worrying about things that you have no way of changing. How many times have you been told that\u2019s a waste of time? And how many times have you resolved to change your ways? Too many. Never mind, maybe this time."}, {"text": "You may not think of yourself as a star or celebrity, as the kind of person that others look up to, but in some ways you are and over the next few days you will attract the kind of attention that makes you realize how highly you are rated."}, {"text": "There is no point cursing fate if what happens this weekend is not to your liking because it won\u2019t change things. What will change, however, is your ability to understand what got you into this position in the first place. Understand it, and act."}, {"text": "Try not to take an irrational dislike to someone you know very little about. Yes, on the surface they may seem a bit too full of themselves, but dig deeper and you will find you have a lot in common. Who knows, you could even become friends."}, {"text": "Tread warily when dealing with people who promise huge returns for just a small investment on your part. You should know by now that the only way to make serious money is by having a seriously good idea and putting some serious work into it."}, {"text": "Some of the people you are close to in life have been a bit moody of late but that should change next week when the sun moves into your fellow water sign of Scorpio. For now, just put up with their silences and strange ways."}, {"text": "You need to learn to take a more laid-back view of the world and its woes. Yes, of course, there are many things that need to be fixed, but there are also many things that are going very well indeed. Involve yourself more in the latter this year."}, {"text": "Relationships won\u2019t seem quite so tense as the new week begins, which is good, but if you want it to stay that way try not to let slip any comments that might upset those of a sensitive disposition. Not everyone is as robust as you Aries."}, {"text": "No matter who you may have fallen out with in recent weeks you can easily make it up with them again. Today\u2019s Venus-Neptune link will help you focus on the things you have in common rather than the things that set you apart. That\u2019s progress."}, {"text": "Do what you feel you have to do today and don\u2019t lose sleep over the possible consequences. What will be will be and, as with so many other similar situations in the past, it\u2019s unlikely to be anywhere near as bad as you initially fear."}, {"text": "Your powers of self-discipline have been tested over the past few days and the good news is you have come through with flying colours. Now you must show other people how to stay calm and not lose their cool in challenging situations. Be a good example."}, {"text": "There has been so much drama in your life of late that you could do with a few days when nothing much happens. Those days will come but not yet. The sun\u2019s imminent change of signs will bring crises that only you know how to deal with."}, {"text": "Venus, planet of love, will assist you in patching up a relationship that may have turned a touch sour in recent weeks. The important thing is to recognize that there is precious little actually wrong with it. You both just need to cool down a bit."}, {"text": "Your ruling planet Venus links with Neptune, planet of empathy, today, so you won\u2019t find it hard to reach out to people who desperately need a helping hand. Don\u2019t be too selective in who you choose to assist \u2013 if others ask you must give what you can."}, {"text": "Everyone has fears and anxieties \u2013 yes, even a Scorpio \u2013 so don\u2019t think you are strange because you worry what the future might bring. But don\u2019t give in to that worry either. Always have a purpose and always keep moving toward it, step by step."}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you stay in a positive frame of mind today, especially if you are involved in situations where everyone needs to pull together to make sure of success. You won\u2019t get far if you are constantly arguing with each other."}, {"text": "An opportunity to improve your status must be take advantage of immediately. If you can\u2019t make up your mind about it over the next day or two it may be taken away from you and given to someone else. Do you really want it Capricorn? Then take it!"}, {"text": "A Venus-Neptune link will brighten your day by helping you to come to terms with the fact that people have a right to be different and that without that difference the world would be a far more boring place. Do you really want everyone to be just like you?"}, {"text": "Neptune, your ruler, links with Venus, planet of love today, making it easy for you to feel other people\u2019s pain. But you must not let their pain become your pain. Help others with their problems if you can but don\u2019t let those problems weigh you down as well."}, {"text": "You will find your voice over the coming 12 months and what you have to tell the world will meet with huge approval. Your way with words and your obvious sincerity will attract praise on both a personal and a professional level. Make it work for you."}, {"text": "You need to start looking at your long-term financial situation in a more serious way. If you are typical of your sign you most likely take money matters as they come, but the planets warn that approach won\u2019t work any more. Start planning ahead."}, {"text": "Partners and loved ones will be a bit more assertive than usual today but that\u2019s okay. With a little bit of thought and effort you can help them harness their energy for more positive things. Partnerships can be highly productive for everyone now."}, {"text": "You will work like a demon over the next few days. You will take on tasks and responsibilities that at most other times you might prefer to avoid. But don\u2019t take on too much and risk burning yourself out. Look ahead and pace yourself."}, {"text": "No matter how tough life may have been for you of late as from today it will start to get better \u2013 much better! Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start doing the things that will make your existence more enjoyable and more productive."}, {"text": "You need to deal with a problem that you have been avoiding for some time. Most likely it involves someone you live with or are related to. Whatever it is that has been dividing you it\u2019s time to kiss and make up, or at least shake hands!"}, {"text": "You may be in an argumentative mood today and even the most mildly expressed statement of belief, if it clashes with your own, could set you off. Don\u2019t expect to get it all your own way though. Others can be just as opinionated as you."}, {"text": "The sun is about to leave your sign but there is no reason why your energy and enthusiasm should wane. You have built up quite a head of steam in recent weeks and if you are smart (and you are!) you will find ways to keep it going."}, {"text": "As the sun is about to join Jupiter in your birth sign you should be feeling quietly confident about your prospects. In a matter of days you won\u2019t be in the least bit quiet though \u2013 you will be singing your own praises loud and clear!"}, {"text": "You may not want to act on the assumption that people could be conspiring against you but the planets warn you cannot afford to take anything on trust, at least for the time being. Be aware that not everyone would like to see you succeed."}, {"text": "You need to rethink something of a creative nature that you had hoped would work but can now recognize is not going to evolve to the point where you are happy with it. It\u2019s no big deal \u2013 you can easily upgrade what you have already done."}, {"text": "As the sun is about to move into the area of your chart that governs your place in the world you must be upbeat about your abilities. What employers and other important people want to see in you is confidence. Fake it if you don\u2019t yet have it."}, {"text": "One of the best times of the year begins tomorrow when the sun moves into your fellow water sign of Scorpio. For the next few weeks you will look at life as a gift rather than as a trial. That\u2019s how you should look at it all the time!"}, {"text": "A new start is possible any day of the year but with the sun changing signs on your birthday this really is the ideal day to move from one way of living to another. It\u2019s all about the future now, so banish the past from your mind."}, {"text": "There are certain issues in your life that need dealing with and can no longer be avoided. Find the courage to make a start and then follow through to the end. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask others for help \u2013 you may be surprised how well they respond."}, {"text": "The sun moves into the partnership area of your chart today, so anything of a one-to-one nature, be it personal or professional, can be changed for the better. A new romantic relationship is possible but you need to be more open about your feelings."}, {"text": "This is the ideal time to make changes to your methods and routines. You may be a creature of habit but you recognize that certain ways of doing things are not working as well as they should, so push your ego to one side and try something different."}, {"text": "You have kept your feelings in check for too long and now you must let them out again. The results could be spectacular! The sun in the sympathetic sign of Scorpio will encourage you to believe that all things are possible \u2013 and they are."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in and around the domestic area of your chart means things may be a bit tense on the home front today. The good news is that if you make an effort to find out why loved ones are so uptight harmony can soon be restored."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to predict what will happen over the next few days because there are so many ways your current situation could play itself out. Just relax and let things happen and be ready to move in a radically new direction."}, {"text": "You need to get serious about your cash-flow situation. The sun\u2019s move into the money area of your chart will make it clear where and how savings need to be made. Looks like that shopping spree you were planning may have to be postponed."}, {"text": "The sun moves into your birth sign today and a new phase begins. Tomorrow\u2019s full moon could bring an unwelcome surprise but once you get past that it should be blue skies and smiles all the way. Life is what you choose to make of it."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart could have a negative effect on your outlook but you must overcome it and strive to be positive. This may be a time for thinking rather than doing but your thoughts don\u2019t have to be glum."}, {"text": "Opportunities will come thick and fast over the next few days. Friendships and group activities are under especially good stars at the moment and if you get out into the world and do things with other people the results could be spectacular."}, {"text": "If you are in any way dissatisfied with your work or career now is the time to make changes. It may even be time to think seriously about taking up a new vocation. Whatever you choose to do you will soon be moving up in the world."}, {"text": "As the sun moves into your fellow water sign of Scorpio today your worries about money and other material matters will begin to fade and in a matter of days won\u2019t bother you at all. But no, that is not an excuse to go on a spree!"}, {"text": "A full moon on your birthday is sure to place obstacles in your path but you will overcome each and every one of them. You will never be asked to take on more than you can handle, so believe in yourself and be the best you can be."}, {"text": "You may look confident on the outside but today\u2019s full moon could dent your self-belief a bit. On the material front, if something you value is taken away from you over the next 24 hours it means you no longer need it \u2013 so let it go."}, {"text": "A full moon in your sign suggests you will have to fight hard to get your way today. You could, of course, decide not to fight at all and let fate take its course but what kind of message would that send to your rivals and enemies?"}, {"text": "The harder you work lately the less you accomplish \u2013 or at least it seems that way. Maybe you should take the hint and stop forcing yourself to do things you don\u2019t really care about, even more so if you are doing them for other people."}, {"text": "Keep your distance from people whose negative outlook could easily get under your skin. Your first and only duty over the next 24 hours is to keep your mind free from ideas that seem to favor the worst possible way of looking at the world."}, {"text": "If you are expecting other people to be enthusiastic about what you are up to then most likely you will be disappointed. But so what? Whether they support you or not will have no effect on the outcome, which depends entirely on you."}, {"text": "You are under no obligation to care as much about other people\u2019s problems as you do your own. Yes, of course, if you get the chance to assist them you should but don\u2019t feel guilty about it if you have to tell them you\u2019re too busy to help."}, {"text": "A positive attitude is essential today, because if you let negative thoughts enter your mind it could stop you taking advantage of opportunities that are designed by the universe to make you materially and emotionally richer. It\u2019s all good, so be happy."}, {"text": "Worrying about things you have no way of controlling is a complete waste of time and emotional energy. What will be will be \u2013 and with the sun now in your sign it will be amazing \u2013 so let go of your doubts and live without fear."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s full moon will in some way or other remind you that you don\u2019t know it all, and never will. Perfection may be something to aim for but it\u2019s not something any human being ever really achieves. There is still so much for you to learn."}, {"text": "You will find it hard to feel sorry for people who have brought their difficulties upon themselves. Having said which, if someone approaches you for assistance you have a duty to support them if you can. Do something that helps them in practical ways."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to interfere in a friend\u2019s private life today but the planets warn that could be a very bad idea. They will learn more in the long-term \u2013 and you will still remain friends \u2013 if you just let them get on with it."}, {"text": "You may want to come and go as you please today but the full moon is unlikely to allow it. If you want to enjoy your independence you must first take care of certain duties and obligations \u2013 you know, those ones you happily signed up for."}, {"text": "Try not to be too generous for your own good. Yes, of course, there are a lot of needy people in the world and if you can do your bit to help some of them that\u2019s good, but taking care of your own needs must still have priority."}, {"text": "You may have a particular goal in mind but don\u2019t focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. You need to be flexible if you are to make the most of the opportunities coming your way. There\u2019s more than one road to success."}, {"text": "You are finding it hard to be honest about your feelings and that\u2019s a shame because others need to know how much you care. Also, if you walk around with a frown on your face they may think they have done something to displease you."}, {"text": "There is a danger at the moment that you will let people get away with things they do not deserve to get away with. It may seem the easy option now but it could cause problems later on when there are more serious issues at stake."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you, so why are you still looking back on things that might have been? Yesterday is over and done with, it\u2019s only tomorrow that matters \u2013 and tomorrow starts right now."}, {"text": "If there is something you feel strongly about you must let others know about it. Don\u2019t keep your feelings hidden because if you internalize them they may damage you in ways you had not expected. Be open about what you feel and what you believe."}, {"text": "Someone needs a helping hand or a shoulder to cry on and you are not the sort to turn them away. You must, however, make sure they know that your help is conditional on them taking more responsibility for themselves in future."}, {"text": "For best results today just sit quietly some place that makes it possible to collect your scattered thoughts. You don\u2019t have to be sociable every day of the week \u2013 six days out of every seven is more than enough \u2013 so enjoy your own company."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you will get too confident and take your eye off the ball. The sun in your sign endows you with a great deal of self-belief (as if you did not have enough already) but that won\u2019t save you if you make silly mistakes."}, {"text": "You may not be the sort to make a big deal of your emotions but you need to let someone know how important they are. You don\u2019t have to declare your undying love but you do have to let them know your feelings for them are sincere."}, {"text": "You cannot be the biggest and the best all the time, so if your ego is feeling a bit deflated today don\u2019t let it worry you. It might pay you to slow down a bit, physically and mentally, as you have been pushing yourself rather hard."}, {"text": "Why are you suddenly so eager to take offence? No doubt it has something to do with Mars in your sign but you don\u2019t have to get angry over every little thing that goes wrong. Rise above petty differences today and treat life as a game."}, {"text": "You will demand to be heard today and if those around you have any sense they will let you say your piece. No doubt some will disagree with your message but what they cannot deny is your passion. You should be passionate more often!"}, {"text": "The sun and Venus join forces on your birthday in a way that guarantees you will be \u201cflavour of the month\u201d for the coming year. Don\u2019t be afraid to take chances because most times you will succeed, and even when you fail no one will mind."}, {"text": "You instinctively know what needs to be done and you won\u2019t hesitate to do it.

They seem to have got it into their head that they can interfere any time they like."}, {"text": "You want to prove you have what it takes to compete at the highest level but watch out you don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew. Everyone has limits, even a Gemini, and you must make sure you know what your limits are."}, {"text": "No matter how many bad things may have happened in the past only good things will happen over the next few days. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart urges you to go out and have fun tonight and over the weekend."}, {"text": "Something you seem to have neglected in recent weeks will suddenly become important to you again, but don\u2019t expect other people to just fall in with your plans, especially if you left them to it before. You\u2019ve got some making up to do!"}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Venus link means you will be feelings relaxed about life in general and about affairs of the heart in particular. Don\u2019t get so relaxed though that you do nothing\u2013 you will have a lot more fun if you are on the move."}, {"text": "Your ruling planet Venus links with the sun today, so good news of one sort or another is sure to come your way. However, as Venus is still moving retrograde you would be wise not to take anything too seriously, including yourself."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to do anything special today, you just have to sit back and let life come to you. With so much beneficial cosmic activity in your sign you only have to put a name to your desires to see to come true. Yes, it\u2019s that easy!"}, {"text": "How much do you think you are worth \u2013 not in a financial sense but in your human value to other people? At this time of year more than most you need friends and family to remind you how much you are cherished \u2013 and they will."}, {"text": "Your personal magnetism will draw important people into your orbit today and if you are able to work together there is no limit to what you can accomplish. Gloss over any minor differences you may have \u2013 they can be safely ignored."}, {"text": "If you show willing over the next 24 hours you will not only get through a huge amount of work but will impress people in positions of power with your professionalism. They are sure to reward you generously, so make an effort to shine."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the sympathetic sign of Scorpio means you can expect good things, and good people, to come your way today and over the weekend. You will be the centre of attention for all the right reasons, and that makes a nice change!"}, {"text": "Saturn\u2019s influence on your birthday means there will be times over the coming year when it feels as if your options are being limited by forces you cannot control. But that\u2019s okay \u2013 it\u2019s just the universe guiding you in the direction that\u2019s best for you."}, {"text": "You may have good reason to be disappointed with a friend but getting angry about it won\u2019t help. The time has come to forgive and forget and let them know that you don\u2019t hold a grudge. You should, however, be careful who you trust in future."}, {"text": "You will be on the move a lot over the next few days and someone you meet on your travels will open your mind to new possibilities. Up until now you\u2019ve had a rather limited understanding of what\u2019s going on in the world. That is about to change."}, {"text": "Even if you are the kind of Gemini who is careful with money (and few are) you will be tempted to splash out on pretty things this weekend. Only buy items that can be returned with no questions asked. You may run out of cash sooner than expected!"}, {"text": "This could be and should be one of the best times of the year for you, so why are you still allowing minor issues to cloud your mind? Whatever the reason you need to get over it fast and raise your sights to bigger and better things. Start now."}, {"text": "If you go out of your way to help people in need this weekend the universe will reward you later on when it is you who is in need of assistance. And if they have brought their troubles on themselves? It doesn\u2019t matter, help them anyway."}, {"text": "There could be some interesting developments in your social life over the next few days, so don\u2019t limit your horizons to places you know and faces that are familiar. Be adventurous. Expand your horizons. The further you travel the more fun you will have."}, {"text": "Often in life it\u2019s not so much what you know as who you know that matters and that is very much the case this weekend. Get out your contacts book and let people whose support you have enjoyed in the past know you are still alive and kicking."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry that others might think you are being irresponsible if you just get up and go some place different over the next 48 hours \u2013 you deserve a break and have every right to take one. If possible, share your journey with someone you love."}, {"text": "A new arrival on your social scene will make a big impression on you and it may be the start of a beautiful friendship. The fact that you seem to be on the same wavelength for so many things means you\u2019ll enjoy being in each other\u2019s company."}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s link to your ruler Saturn will bring your sense of duty to the fore and you will go all out to complete a project that others are depending on to come right.

You don\u2019t have to do anything special this weekend because the things you need will come to you \u2013 as will some very interesting people."}, {"text": "Be careful who you confide in over the next 48 hours because not everyone has your interests at heart. You should know by now who you can trust, so if you have any worries to discuss go to them and no one else \u2013 don\u2019t make personal issues public."}, {"text": "If you can fix your vision on a single aim or ambition over the coming year then there really is no limit to how high you can climb. What is the one thing that would transform your life from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat\u201d? Make that one thing your guiding star."}, {"text": "Be ruthless today, both with yourself and with other people. You may want to be friendly with certain individuals but if they are in the way of your ambitions then you must brush them aside. If you don\u2019t, your efforts could fall short of expectations."}, {"text": "Yes, to an extent you will have to dance to someone else\u2019s tune today, but no, that does not mean you won\u2019t have a say in what takes place. Your voice is as important as anyone else\u2019s, and your friends and work colleagues instinctively know this."}, {"text": "You will get the chance to make a good impression on the work front today and you must seize it with both hands. The planets warn if you hesitate for even a moment a rival could nip in and get ahead of you in the race to move up."}, {"text": "Under no circumstances should you back away from your needs and desires today. A new moon in your fellow water sign of Scorpio means you don\u2019t need to make deals to succeed \u2013 on the contrary, you will do so much better if you go it alone.

Just this once, let them decide which games you are going to play. "}, {"text": "You must speak up and say your piece. A few people may not like your loud and overly assertive manner but you can afford to ignore them because those who really matter will be impressed by your get up and go. So get up and shout!"}, {"text": "There are some strong emotions at play in your world at the moment and today\u2019s new moon will bring them into focus. Remember, just because someone is acting crazy does not necessarily mean they are crazy. Maybe it\u2019s just an act to fool you."}, {"text": "Any day can be a new beginning and the new moon in your sign makes this the day you can, if you wish, start again with a clean conscience and a blank slate. Listen to what your inner voice is trying to tell you \u2013 then act on it decisively."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to shun the limelight but a new moon in the most secretive area of your chart means you may prefer to stay in the shadows today. From there you can work out what\u2019s really going on, as opposed to what others claim is going on."}, {"text": "If you make an effort to communicate with someone you don\u2019t always get along with you may be surprised to discover that you actually have a lot in common. Your outlook on life is similar but you tend to express it in different ways, that\u2019s all."}, {"text": "You must not give in to pressure today, especially on the work front and especially when dealing with people who have the power and influence to make life tough for you. They will respect you more if you stand tall and stand up to them."}, {"text": "If you have been thinking about moving on from your present environment then you can take that to another level today by actually looking around for somewhere else to stay. A change is as good as a rest, so don\u2019t be afraid to walk on and walk far."}, {"text": "You need to stop thinking that you have to plan everything out in great detail. The message of your birthday chart is that you will do better \u2013 much better, in fact \u2013 if you keep your aims vague and take each day as it comes. Let the universe guide you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that nothing can go wrong for you now because the planets warn there are still a few obstacles up ahead that you will need to get past. Keep your eyes and ears open over the next few days."}, {"text": "Before you make your next move you must ask the people you are closest to emotionally what they think about what you are planning to do. If they are in any way negative about it you must ask them why. Their input could be priceless."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if you do not get the support you were hoping for over the next three or four days because you are quite capable of doing what has to be done on your own. You don\u2019t need other people\u2019s approval \u2013 only your own!"}, {"text": "Check and then check again is the message of the stars for you as the new week begins. It may seem as if something you are working on is going according to plan but could there be something you have missed, something that might cause problems?"}, {"text": "You may be tempted to give up on something that is not working out the way you expected but you must stick with it a while longer. Put it on the back burner for a few days and give your mind time to come up with a solution."}, {"text": "Make allowances for those who do not share your sense of adventure. Everyone is different and everyone has their own path to take through life. If your paths converge over the next few days, that\u2019s great. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s great too."}, {"text": "Every now and then you throw caution to the wind and that seems to be the kind of mood you are in at the moment. Just be careful you are not more reckless than courageous, because if you go too far it could end in tears."}, {"text": "You will receive some kind of offer today and you will be reluctant to turn it down. But turn it down you must because the planets warn if it sounds too good to be true then it most likely is. Listen to what your inner voice tells you."}, {"text": "Keep your schemes and dreams to yourself over the next two or three days, because if the wrong person gets to hear what you are planning they may try to steal your ideas or sabotage your efforts. Not everyone wants to see you succeed."}, {"text": "If someone has done you a favour then you should find a way to repay them over the next few days. However, if you have done a good deed for someone else, you must not expect to get something back in return. Generosity is its own reward."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t get hot under the collar if a friend tries to remind you that you are only human and that you have faults like everyone else. It\u2019s true after all, and they are only trying to save you from making a fool of yourself. You should thank them."}, {"text": "More than anything else over the coming week you must strive to avoid doing things that, if they go wrong, could have an adverse effect on your reputation. What other people think of you matters, though not as much as what you think of yourself."}, {"text": "What sacrifices are you prepared to make to realize your dreams? That is the question you need to answer on your birthday and you should think about it long and hard before making a decision. Life could still be good if you make no sacrifices at all."}, {"text": "Try not to jump to conclusions of any sort today because there is a good chance they could be wrong. Venus, your ruler, warns that if you slip up in any way, shape or form, it could have consequences that are not to your liking."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t complain, don\u2019t explain, and certainly don\u2019t apologize. That is the message of the stars for you today Taurus and if you heed it you will sail past events that upset other people with a minimum of fuss. Refuse to let life get you down."}, {"text": "Take extra care when dealing with matters where there could be money at stake. You may think you need to grab what you can get but the planets promise there is more than enough to go around. Make sure others get their share as well."}, {"text": "The sun in the sympathetic sign of Scorpio does wonders for your confidence and that\u2019s just as well because other aspects warn that someone will go out of their way to make you feel bad about yourself today. They won\u2019t remotely succeed."}, {"text": "Someone who knows how your mind works will try to manoeuvre you in a direction that is of benefit to them but could cost you dearly. The moment you realize what they are up to you must call a halt. Don\u2019t let them use you."}, {"text": "Because you are flexible by nature you don\u2019t find it hard to make compromises, but that could work against you today. You are under no obligation to change what you are doing just to please other people. Pleasing yourself is more important."}, {"text": "It would appear that you are trying too hard to please someone who does not deserve your attention and not hard enough to please someone who does. You need to get your priorities sorted before you lose a friend and make an enemy."}, {"text": "Do what feels right to you today and don\u2019t be surprised if someone makes a big negative noise about it. You are under no obligation to play down your own needs and desires just to please other people, not even people you love."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t see eye-to-eye with someone over a money matter today but it\u2019s not as big a deal as you might think, so don\u2019t get angry about it. Compromise is possible if you give it time, and time is something you have plenty of."}, {"text": "There is a danger that you could read all sorts of weird and wonderful meanings into what is really quite a straightforward situation. Your imagination is a powerful tool but you must learn to control it or it could end up controlling you!"}, {"text": "You will have to make one or two changes today and you probably won\u2019t be happy about it, especially if they have been forced on you by other people\u2019s stupidity or selfishness. Be that as it may it\u2019s not worth getting worked up about, so don\u2019t."}, {"text": "It does not matter if your creative ideas are met with a certain amount of opposition today \u2013 it matters only that you have enough confidence in what you are doing to carry on regardless. One day you will look back and say \u201cI told you so!\u201d"}, {"text": "You know you are capable of so much more but sometimes you find it hard to get motivated and get moving. That won\u2019t be such a problem over the coming 12 months, not least because you desperately need to make some serious money."}, {"text": "You want to bring some kind of feud to an end but you don\u2019t want to admit that it was mainly you who was in the wrong. Look for a compromise solution today but make sure you can do so from a position of strength."}, {"text": "You seem rather sensitive to criticism at the moment but you must not allow yourself to get emotional about what other people say. Pretend you don\u2019t care in the slightest what they think or feel. Put on an act and make it a good one."}, {"text": "You won't be short of admirers today but you cannot possibly accept each and every social invitation that is going to come your way, so be selective and only show your face at events that might be good for you career-wise."}, {"text": "You must not take what others tell you too seriously today, especially if what they tell you is negative in nature. It could be they believe what they say but more likely they are trying to make you look small to make themselves look big in the mirror."}, {"text": "If you are bored with your current social scene then get up and go some place else. There must be a party or two going on in your neighbourhood and, if there isn\u2019t, there is nothing stopping you from throwing one of your own."}, {"text": "You may be in a dynamic sort of mood but you must not let it drive you to the point where you start taking the kind of risks you would usually strive to avoid. Listen to your inner voice and only act on what it tells you."}, {"text": "As Venus, your ruler, moves back into your sign today this is a good time to let those you care about know how much you love them. Don\u2019t worry if not everyone responds with the same level of enthusiasm. Not everyone is as expressive as you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if your rivals seem to pull ahead of you over the next few days. Most likely they are cutting corners or in some other way getting an unfair advantage. In the long-term though it is sure to count against them."}, {"text": "No matter what your differences with someone may be you must make an effort to find a compromise solution. There is so much you can accomplish over the next week or so while Jupiter remains in your sign \u2013 don\u2019t let petty squabbles hold you back."}, {"text": "Steer clear of people who annoy you because the planets warn that the more you try to be nice to them today the more they will see that as a sign of weakness. You don\u2019t have to play their silly game. Just give them a miss."}, {"text": "It will pay you to keep your ideas to yourself today, because if you let slip what you are thinking someone may steal your insights and use them for their own benefit. It may be immoral but it\u2019s not illegal, so don\u2019t give too much away."}, {"text": "It may seem as if certain people are conspiring against you but are they really or are you going through one of those typically Piscean phases when you think the world is against you for no good reason? Most likely it\u2019s the latter, so get over it."}, {"text": "You will be in the public eye a lot this year, which at times you will enjoy but at other times you will hate. Like it or not you can\u2019t have one without the other. On balance though you are extremely lucky that so many people want to see you."}, {"text": "There are so many things you want to change in your life but is this really the right time to be changing them? According to the planets if you leave it a week or two, or maybe even three, your efforts will have much more of an impact."}, {"text": "You may be reluctant to admit that you got the wrong end of the stick and accused someone of things they did not do but you really have no choice. One of the hallmarks of your sign is your honesty, so admit you got it wrong."}, {"text": "Put petty disagreements behind you and give others the benefit of the doubt. Some things are worth getting worked up about but most things are not, so try not to get emotional over matters that a few days from now won\u2019t matter in the slightest."}, {"text": "If life seems a bit too easy of late that\u2019s good because it means you are in the groove and getting done what needs to be done. The sun in Scorpio is blowing the wind into your sails, so off you go \u2013 and have a great journey!"}, {"text": "You may be of the opinion that you should not act yet because you expect a better offer to come along soon, but can you be sure of that? It might be best to take the deal that is on the table in front of you right now."}, {"text": "Let your hair down and have a good time today. Cosmic activity in the most outgoing area of your chart promises you can and you will enjoy mixing with all sorts of people \u2013 yes, even people you usually can\u2019t stand the sight of!"}, {"text": "Try to do something that makes you feel good about yourself today. It does not matter if that something is important or productive \u2013 all that matters is that you enjoy it and have fun doing it. You\u2019ve worked hard of late, so now it\u2019s time to play."}, {"text": "You will have to take care of a lot of routine chores today and while it may be boring it is also of the utmost importance because it will clear the decks and make it easier to focus on more important things tomorrow and over the weekend."}, {"text": "Try not to spread yourself too thin over the next 24 hours. You may think you have enough physical and mental energy to reach all those wonderful targets you\u2019ve set yourself but the planets warn you may be closer to the edge than you realize."}, {"text": "You seem to believe that you should be doing more and you should be doing better but most likely it is your desire for perfection that is pushing you to make so many demands on yourself. You\u2019re human, so don\u2019t set yourself superhuman standards."}, {"text": "Try not to take what other people say too seriously today because among all the good advice there may be some bad advice that could trip you up. It would be nice to believe that everyone is on your side but, seriously, how likely is that?"}, {"text": "It may be time to remind those who seem to have forgotten that you are a free spirit and have every right to come and go as you please. The sun in the most adventurous area of your chart is encouraging you to stand up for your rights."}, {"text": "Life should be good for you at the moment and according to the cosmic picture on your birthday it will get even better over the next few months. To get the most from your days \u2013 and your nights \u2013 believe that the universe is smiling on you, because it is."}, {"text": "If there is something about your work situation you don\u2019t much enjoy there is nothing stopping you from changing it. But before you do ask yourself, honestly, if you really dislike it that much or if you are just momentarily bored. It could be the latter."}, {"text": "Something will happen either today or over the weekend that takes you by surprise and makes you wonder if maybe you have been a bit too hasty in your judgment of someone. Maybe they are not as dumb as you thought they were."}, {"text": "It may feel as if you are running out of time and need to get your act together quickly but is that really the case or are you putting yourself under pressure for no good reason? The planets indicate that you don\u2019t need to rush things."}, {"text": "You must not let other people\u2019s overly cautious ways hold you back from trying something new. You may not be the most adventurous sign of the zodiac but you have your moments and over the next few days you may have several."}, {"text": "You only like surprises when it is you who is doing the surprising and because what occurs over the next 24 hours catches you unaware you won\u2019t be too happy about it. Keep the smile on your face though \u2013 don\u2019t let others see they got to you."}, {"text": "You must look for ways to settle a dispute amicably today, because if you allow it to drag on much longer it will taint everything else you are doing. Even if someone owes you an apology, be the one who says sorry first. Pretend that you mean it."}, {"text": "The more you try to please partners and loved ones the less happy with you they seem to get, so you might as well stop trying altogether and do only what amuses you. Strangely, they may be happier with that than if you try to please them."}, {"text": "If someone needs a helping hand today or over the weekend then give it to them with a smile on your face and don\u2019t ask for or expect anything in return. The universe will reward your generosity in other, less materialistic, ways."}, {"text": "You want to be dynamic, you want to be ambitious, but you can\u2019t seem to get started. Most likely it is the sun\u2019s influence in the most sensitive area of your chart that is holding you back. There\u2019s a good cosmic reason for it."}, {"text": "It may be the case that you have no influence over certain situations but try not to feel bad about it. Life moves in cycles and while you may be on the down side of the curve now it won\u2019t be long before you are moving up again."}, {"text": "All possible routes you can take will eventually lead to your ultimate destination, so don\u2019t worry that you might be going in the wrong direction \u2013 there is no such thing as a wrong direction. Enjoy life no matter where it seems to be taking you."}, {"text": "You must be ready to take advantage of an unexpected opportunity today. A friend or a work colleague or maybe even a total stranger will make you the kind of offer you find hard to believe \u2013 but it\u2019s also very much on the level, so say \u201cYes\u201d."}, {"text": "This could be and should be one of the very best times of your life. All that is good about your sign \u2013 your courage, your confidence, your self-belief \u2013 will carry you forward like never before. Dream the impossible dream, then make it happen."}, {"text": "You would be wise not to believe everything that you see and hear over the next 48 hours because almost certainly someone is feeding you wrong information. The only voice you should listen to is the voice that comes from within. It knows the answers."}, {"text": "You seem to be Mr. or Ms. Popular at the moment and that\u2019s very nice, but don\u2019t get carried away and start thinking you can do as you please. You still have responsibilities to take care of, and you won\u2019t be popular for long if you neglect them."}, {"text": "You won't be much in the mood for work this weekend and that\u2019s good because the planets suggest that the best way to get things done is to do nothing at all. Even a Gemini can benefit from a physical and mental recharge once in a while."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in your fellow water sign of Scorpio endows you with the kind of can-do attitude that gets things done in record quick time. You don\u2019t have to do it all on your own though. Others will happily assist you if you ask them nicely."}, {"text": "You must not let your feelings get in the way of facts this weekend, and the No. 1 fact you need to be aware of is that on the domestic front you cannot hope to please everyone. Ultimately, of course, the person you need to please most is yourself."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to go over the top emotionally and declare your undying love for someone but you might do that this weekend. No doubt you\u2019ll be embarrassed later on when reason kicks in but it\u2019s good to remind others that you have feelings, too."}, {"text": "Money and status may seem important to you now but later on you will look back and realize that it\u2019s love alone that makes the world go round. Having said that, don\u2019t waste your cash on frivolous things \u2013 it\u2019s still a resource to be conserved."}, {"text": "You have every right and every reason to enjoy yourself now and no one has the right to suggest that you take life in a more serious fashion. What does \u201cserious\u201d mean anyway? What\u2019s serious to someone else may seem hilariously funny to you."}, {"text": "Why is it that everyone but you is having fun? What have you done so wrong that you must watch from the sidelines while others enjoy themselves? In reality, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong at all, except maybe let negative thoughts unbalance your mind."}, {"text": "You can afford to be generous over the next few days, especially when dealing with people who, for whatever reason, find it hard to share in the things that come to you as if by right. Enjoy your good fortune \u2013 and spread it around."}, {"text": "If someone tries to abuse their authority you must make it clear to them that you are not going to stand for it. If there is one thing you truly hate it is being told what to do by people you have no respect for. Don\u2019t let it happen."}, {"text": "The planets are encouraging you to strike out in a new direction and deep down you know it is now or never. Do you have the courage to take that first step into the unknown? If you do, all the other steps will come easy to you."}, {"text": "Whatever challenges you face over the coming year you will deal with them all with ease. There is something in the Scorpio nature that enjoys being put to the test and even the powers that be will be impressed with your creativity and can-do attitude."}, {"text": "You should not pretend that you care about someone when, in all honesty, you don\u2019t have the slightest positive feelings for them. That may sound a bit harsh but you must be true to your own instincts, Aries. If you ignore those instincts you may regret it."}, {"text": "Someone you don\u2019t get along with will be overly friendly towards you today and, of course, you will wonder what they are up to. However, it could be the case that they simply want to get on better terms with you. Be smart and meet them halfway."}, {"text": "Major changes are taking place in your world and you would not be human if they did not worry you. By all means share your concerns with people you trust, but don\u2019t get so caught up in events that you start believing the end is nigh. It isn\u2019t!"}, {"text": "The best way to get over a situation that makes you anxious is to expose yourself to what worries you about it the most. Throw yourself in at the deep end today and force yourself to find ways to overcome your fears. You won\u2019t sink \u2013 you\u2019ll swim just fine."}, {"text": "A choice you make about a relationship will take you in one of two very different directions, so think carefully before you make it. If the other person is important to you then you must take their needs and desires into account as much as you do your own."}, {"text": "You may be a bit more pushy than usual over the next 24 hours and there is nothing wrong with that, but make sure you push for the right reasons. Some things in life are important and some things are not \u2013 make sure you know which is which."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign gives you so much energy that it may sometimes be a problem deciding what to do with it all. Over the next few days that energy could easily turn to anger unless you find a positive outlet for it. Do something intensely creative."}, {"text": "Try not to be aggressive for no good reason. In fact, try not to be aggressive at all. You may feel you have a valid excuse to go on the attack but if there is a better way to get what you desire then that is the way you must go."}, {"text": "The first step in any new activity is often the hardest but now you have taken that first step the rest should be easy \u2013 well, sort of. Remind yourself often that anything worth having is worth really working for. Make sacrifices if you have to."}, {"text": "You cannot possibly be in control of every little thing that happens in your world, so stop trying to direct events as if you alone have a right or a responsibility to call the shots. Try standing back and letting others lead the way for a while."}, {"text": "The possibility of failure does not bother you in the slightest, mainly because you trust yourself to get it right, but also because you know that if something does go wrong you have the intelligence to adjust quickly and make it go right again."}, {"text": "Your artistic talents are beginning to attract the attention of people who can help you do something with them. Too often in the past you have come up with some fantastic ideas but failed to see them through. This time there will be no stopping you."}, {"text": "Most things will come easy to you over the coming year but one thing will take a bit of effort \u2013 and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, that is the most important thing by far. Give it everything you\u2019ve got, then give it a bit more. The rewards will astound you."}, {"text": "You will find it amazingly easy to get on with people today and you must use that ability to persuade them to give you what it is you need. Make it sound as if what you are requesting will be as good for them as it is for you."}, {"text": "You seem to have lost direction a bit of late, but today your aims and ambitions will be crystal clear. You know exactly what it is you want from life and exactly what you must do to get it. Knowing isn\u2019t doing though, so get on with it!"}, {"text": "It\u2019s time to bring an issue that you have been trying to ignore into the open where it can be acknowledged and discussed and then dealt with once and for all. Don\u2019t try to blame everyone but yourself for what\u2019s gone wrong. You\u2019re all involved."}, {"text": "You have at last been able to shake off something that has been holding you back and now all you have to do is move forward as fast as you can. Between now and Wednesday\u2019s new moon you can and you must raise your game."}, {"text": "If someone places an obstacle in your path today \u2013 and they will \u2013 your first reaction will be to smash through it. As a strategy it may not be subtle but, yes, it will most likely work. That\u2019s because when you smash, things stay smashed!"}, {"text": "You must learn to trust other people more Virgo, because if you let your suspicions get the better of you today you may miss out on something good. Try not to be so defensive \u2013 the world is not nearly as harsh as you think."}, {"text": "It does not matter that you fell out with someone in the dim and distant past \u2013 the only thing that matters is that you can work together now. Whatever your personal differences may be they don\u2019t have to spoil your working relationship."}, {"text": "You may be right in thinking that you know what is best for other people, but you don\u2019t have the right to force them. You need to get your head round that fact today or you could end up in a huge \u2013 and hugely unnecessary \u2013 row."}, {"text": "You will have plenty to say for yourself as the new week begins and you will no doubt say it long and loud. But try to make sure what you say is positive, because the people you have to deal with need to be inspired, not terrified."}, {"text": "If the only way to come to grips with a situation that has drifted on too long is to make an unpopular decision then make it and have done with it. Yes, of course, some people will be mightily displeased, but most people will be happy about it."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign gives you the courage to take risks but don\u2019t go mad and do something rash. Also, don\u2019t get carried away with your own brilliance and refuse to listen to your inner vice, the part of you that knows all the answers."}, {"text": "If you do not feel comfortable where you are then get up and leave. Nothing is stopping you and no one will think less of you for wanting a change of scenery. And if for some reason they do think less of you, it doesn\u2019t matter."}, {"text": "You have always been a creative sort but over the next 12 months your ability to make something out of nothing will increase dramatically. Don\u2019t focus on making money or boosting your reputation \u2013 focus on what you can give to the world."}, {"text": "As Uranus, planet of changes, moves back into your sign you may be tempted to junk everything you have been doing and start again from scratch. Don\u2019t. Whatever your misgivings may be you are actually making significant progress. Don\u2019t waste it."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Neptune link will bring the generous and forgiving part of your nature to the fore. You will go out of your way to do things for people even if you think they don\u2019t really deserve it. You can\u2019t be bothered with the blame game any more."}, {"text": "By all means help someone who is going through a bad time, but don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking you must be there for them every time. At some stage they are going to have to learn to look after themselves. Maybe that stage should start today."}, {"text": "If someone tries to make a big deal of something you think is of no importance just ignore them. You don\u2019t have to see the situation from their point of view. You don\u2019t have to know where they are coming from. Put your needs first."}, {"text": "Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, and if it does you must deal with it ruthlessly. Whether it is you who is jealous of someone else\u2019s success, or someone else who is jealous of your success, there can be no place for negative feelings."}, {"text": "Nothing will daunt you over the next 24 hours. Somewhere deep inside you know with absolute certainty that what you are doing is right and that the universe will guide and protect you. How can you be defeated when you feel so positive?"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste time trying to defend yourself against other people\u2019s accusations and snide asides. Just ignore them with grand contempt and carry on as before. The fact that they oppose you so strongly means you must be doing something right."}, {"text": "You have been pushing yourself hard of late and will continue to exert maximum effort over the next few weeks, and that\u2019s good. But give yourself a break now and again. It\u2019s not only your physical batteries that need recharging but your mental ones too."}, {"text": "You have so many opportunities to choose from at the moment that it may be a bit confusing. How do you know which is the right one for you? Slow down your mind a bit and let your inner voice speak to you. It knows what you need."}, {"text": "You must stay focused today, because if you allow your thoughts to wander even a little bit they may end up miles from where they should be. Your imagination should be your tool, not your master, so tame it and make it work for you."}, {"text": "You may look calm on the outside but on the inside there is a great deal of anger \u2013 and it must be dealt with. Whatever it is that has annoyed you to such an extent there is no point going to war over it. Forgive, forget and move on."}, {"text": "Be careful when dealing with people who seem to say all the right things and in such a nice way, because they could be setting you up for a fall. The more someone promises they can make you rich the more likely it is they will make you poor!"}, {"text": "A new moon on your birthday makes this the perfect time to start a new phase in your life. Both on a mental and an emotional level you know you need to move on and follow your dream. This year you won\u2019t just follow it, you\u2019ll live it!"}, {"text": "You may need to go on the attack today where money matters and business issues are concerned. A new moon in the wealth area of your chart means it won\u2019t take much effort to bring the good things in life your way, so be assertive."}, {"text": "It may be easy, and justified, to get angry with people who have let you down but it won\u2019t change anything, so stay calm and look for other ways to get things done. Where relationships are concerned your best partnership is with yourself."}, {"text": "You seem to be working extremely hard at the moment, pushing yourself above and beyond your usual limits. However, once you have reached your target you must take it easy for a bit. You are closer to your breaking point than you seem to realize."}, {"text": "If you can bring what you are working on to a conclusion before the end of the week it is sure to be a massive success, so make an extra effort while the universe is on your side and break through whatever barrier has been holding you back."}, {"text": "You will have to deal with something of an emotional nature today, but if you get in quickly and get things sorted it won\u2019t cause you too much trouble. Others will be amazed by your can-do attitude, but for you it\u2019s just business as usual."}, {"text": "Your way with words will win everyone round to your way of thinking today. Whether your way of thinking is the right way is, of course, another matter entirely. Leave the emotional stuff to other people \u2013 you can and you must deal only in facts."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon will reward you in ways you were not expecting, but don\u2019t doubt for a moment that you deserve it. If you suddenly find yourself with a surplus of cash use some of it to help people in need, if possible on a personal level."}, {"text": "Do something dramatic today, something that makes the world sit up and take notice. A new moon in your sign endows you with self-belief and the determination to get things done, to make a difference, to be a force for good. So get on with it!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means you need to take care of certain issues before you can move on. What those issues are only you know for sure but don\u2019t waste this opportunity \u2013 you may not get another one for a while."}, {"text": "Friends, work colleagues and even people you hardly know will do almost anything for you today. You may get a bit suspicious and wonder why everyone is being so nice to you but don\u2019t let that hold you back. The world thinks you are special."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon urges you to pluck up the courage to approach someone in a position of power. Make contact and make sure they know who you are and what you can do. It won\u2019t be long before they invite you to do it for them."}, {"text": "Some people may say you are aiming too high but you know anything is possible if you truly believe. The planets are giving you the kind of confidence you wish you could have every day of the week \u2013 but you\u2019ve got it now, so use it."}, {"text": "As Jupiter, planet of good fortune, moves into the financial area of your chart on your birthday this year you will be focusing more on money matters and business issues. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being rich \u2013 as you\u2019re about to find out."}, {"text": "The world will be a happier place for you as from today as Jupiter, planet of good fortune and bringer of joy, moves into one of the best areas of your chart. Yes, of course, you still need to be serious and responsible, but have fun as well."}, {"text": "If you need to get along with someone you fell out with recently now is the time to approach them and let them know you want to be friends again. Your reasons for doing so may have more to do with profit than friendship but that\u2019s okay."}, {"text": "You will accomplish more today if you resist the urge to make detailed plans. At the same time you need to get other people to take up some of your workload. You don\u2019t have to do it all on your own Gemini. Be kind to yourself."}, {"text": "If you need to repair a working relationship this is the moment to reach out and offer the hand of friendship. Let others know that what\u2019s done is done and you don\u2019t hold any grudges. With luck they will feel the same way about you."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the best days of the year for you as Jupiter, planet of luck, moves into the sympathetic sign of Sagittarius. Good things and good people will come your way over the next few days. Expect the best and you will get the best."}, {"text": "By all means make plans today but don\u2019t forget that other people will be affected by what you decide to do. You are more likely to enjoy success in the long-term if you consult loved ones in the short-term. Listen to their ideas as well."}, {"text": "Your mind will be full of big ideas today and if you let your imagination lead you there is no telling what wonderful places you might end up. Don\u2019t worry that some of those ideas may seem too fantastic to ever come true \u2013 you may be surprised."}, {"text": "You will be called upon to lead by example today, both in your personal life and at work, and being a highly responsible Scorpio you will make efforts above and beyond the call of duty to show how it should be done. Don\u2019t exhaust yourself though."}, {"text": "Jupiter, planet of good fortune \u2013 and also your ruler \u2013 moves into your birth sign today and you could not ask for a better omen for happiness and success. You\u2019ve still got to make an effort, of course, but those efforts will now really pay off."}, {"text": "If you want to get on in the world you have to take a few risks, but the danger now is you may get so desperate to succeed that some of the risks you take are plain stupid. What happened to cautious Capricorn? Get some balance back."}, {"text": "Friendships and group activities are under excellent stars, so don\u2019t sit in the corner all on your own, get out into the world and make contact with . . . just about everyone. The more you give of yourself the more you will get in return."}, {"text": "How well do you handle pressure? If you are typical of your sign you generally don\u2019t like to be forced into the spotlight but today things will be different. For some reason you are desperate to be noticed. Just don\u2019t do anything too outrageous! "}, {"text": "A Venus-Mars link on your birthday indicates that affairs of the heart will go well for you over the coming 12 months. Having said that, Venus is still going through one of its retrograde phases, so do not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 take loved ones for granted."}, {"text": "If you make it your business to make other people feel good about themselves today then you will feel good as well. The more you get out and about and mix with people from all walks of life the more enjoyable your own life will be."}, {"text": "The planets indicate that this is an especially good day to approach new people and make new friends. It does not matter whether your instincts are personal or professional \u2013 being more sociable than usual will profit you in numerous ways. "}, {"text": "You may be eager to prove yourself but you must also be sensible about how much you can expect to accomplish. Decide what your No. 1 aim is going to be and put 90 per cent of your effort into that. Be selective and you\u2019ll be successful."}, {"text": "You will feel at one with the world around you today, which is great, but don\u2019t get carried away and think that everyone you interact with is enjoying the same positive vibes as you. If you think like that you may find yourself taken advantage of."}, {"text": "You will gain more in the long-term if you help others as well as yourself. With Jupiter mow moving in your favour you will find that a good deed done now will pay off handsomely later on. Everything you do must bring a smile to someone\u2019s face."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite possible you will come into money over the next few days. It\u2019s also quite possible that you will spend what you gain almost as soon as you get it. And why shouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s what money can buy that makes life fun."}, {"text": "Venus, your ruler, is now back in your sign and today links with Mars, planet of desire. What that suggests is that over the next few days you will lust after someone you may not be able to have. Give it time though \u2013 circumstances will change."}, {"text": "Try not to make promises you are not 100-per-cent sure you will be able to keep. The planets warn if you let someone down today they may hold a grudge about it for some time to come. Always offer less and then try to deliver more."}, {"text": "You need to get more involved with a cause that has been close to your heart for some time. If you believe in it strongly enough you should be prepared to give more than your tacit support \u2013 you need to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty."}, {"text": "Because you don\u2019t like to refuse doing favours for friends and family members you may find that most of your time today is taken up with doing things for other people. That\u2019s okay, but make up for it over the weekend by doing something for yourself."}, {"text": "With love planet Venus linking with Mars in your sign relationships of all kinds will go well for you today and, hopefully, over the weekend too. If you can get the balance right between being serious and having fun you could have the time of your life."}, {"text": "If you want to feel good about yourself today you should spend more time with the kind of friends who always seem positive about life. Yes, there are a lot of bad things going on in the world, but overall it\u2019s still a wonderful place."}, {"text": "You can and you will accomplish great things in the world at large over the coming year but you will also learn a great deal about yourself on a spiritual level and that\u2019s far more important. Look deep inside yourself, then be who you truly are."}, {"text": "This could be an important weekend for money and business issues, so make sure you know what is going on and make sure you weigh up all the options before deciding what your next course of action is going to be. Do not, repeat not, act on impulse."}, {"text": "It may at times seem as if the whole world is against you but deep down you know that isn\u2019t true, so stop being dramatic. Also, don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that those who disagree with you are your enemies \u2013 they may actually be your friends."}, {"text": "Your mind is full of big ideas but will you have the time and the energy available to do something with all of them? Probably not, so decide which single one of them is of most importance to you and focus only on that this weekend."}, {"text": "The sun in your fellow water sign of Scorpio, linked to power planet, Pluto, makes this an excellent time to start something new. You may not think of yourself as the creative sort but you are, so try your hand at something of an artistic nature."}, {"text": "The more certain people try to tell you that what you are doing is misguided the more convinced you will be that their motives are suspect. Don\u2019t listen to other people, listen to your own inner voice \u2013 and then do exactly what it tells you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if your ability to travel is limited over the next 48 hours \u2013 you will find all the excitement you need close to home. Spend time with people who are on your wavelength physically, mentally and emotionally. Together you\u2019ll be unbeatable."}, {"text": "You need to take a fresh approach to a money matter or a family issue that has been causing you no end of trouble. A potent sun-Pluto link will encourage you to lay down the law and demand that others start taking the situation as seriously as you do."}, {"text": "You seem to be on a different level to most of those around you at the moment and with your ruling planet Pluto on fine form this weekend you may end up on a different planet! Don\u2019t forget to help out your struggling and still earthbound friends."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to be suspicious Sag. You don\u2019t have to believe that secret enemies are out to make you look bad. Even if it were true \u2013 and it isn\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019ve got what it takes to see them all off and smile while you\u2019re doing it."}, {"text": "Sometimes you get an almost overwhelming urge to interfere in what other people are doing \u2013 to meddle, in other words \u2013 and it rarely makes you many friends. You need to resist that urge this weekend. Let others learn from their own mistakes."}, {"text": "If you are not happy with your current position, either at work or in your private life, then do something about it. You say you cannot afford to make changes? That may be true in a financial sense but on a higher level you cannot afford not to."}, {"text": "You should know by now that there are as many opinions as there are people \u2013 also, that just because an opinion comes from someone in a position of power does not mean it is right. Bear that in mind today, especially if you\u2019re the one with the power!"}, {"text": "You may think you know the difference between what is right and what is wrong but what occurs over the coming year or so may cause you to reconsider. What you see and believe in life very much depends on where you choose to stand."}, {"text": "There may be times when it seems as if you are the only one who has not been let in on a secret, but is that really the case or are you being left out because you give others the impression that you don\u2019t want to join in?"}, {"text": "It is important that you make time for other people over the next two or three days, as the full moon in your sign warns you won\u2019t get far if everything you do is purely for your own benefit. Make your world a sharing world."}, {"text": "You must stay on top of your workload today and tomorrow. If you start to fall behind it will be extremely hard to catch up again, so make time for the things that have to be done \u2013 and spend less time on trivialities."}, {"text": "If you make any kind of promise today you must be able to deliver on it. If you let others down they will be after you constantly and it won\u2019t be a lot of fun. Don\u2019t make promises simply because you feel it is expected of you."}, {"text": "Keep your wits about you today and make sure you know what is going on both at home and at work. You don\u2019t have to be overly suspicious about what others are up to but you do need to keep an eye on them, just in case."}, {"text": "Some of the people you meet today will be a lot of fun, but others will be a total pain, so be ready to act in the appropriate manner. If someone isn\u2019t nice to you don\u2019t make an issue of it, just turn your back and walk away."}, {"text": "Although it may feel as if you are falling behind in certain areas you must not worry and starting rushing things. What needs to be done will get done eventually, so calm down, slow down and, most importantly, keep your blood pressure down!"}, {"text": "The full moon warns that you need to plan your moves carefully, especially if they could affect the people around you. You don\u2019t live in isolation (though sometimes you think you might like to) so be aware that your actions have consequences."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to be emotional for no apparent reason but the full moon could play havoc with your feelings over the next two or three days. More than anything you must refuse to give in to self-pity. Smile wide and smile often."}, {"text": "If you have an important decision to make it might be wise to leave it a day or two until the full moon begins to fade. It\u2019s unlikely you will be thinking straight over the next 48 hours, so don\u2019t make any sudden changes."}, {"text": "You want to get serious about your career but it seems you are still mentally and emotionally undecided which path to take. What occurs either today or tomorrow will point you in the right direction. All you have to do then is march."}, {"text": "You seem a lot more relaxed about life now the sun is moving through your fellow water sign of Scorpio, and that\u2019s good. But don\u2019t get so relaxed that you simply ignore what needs to be done. You still have responsibilities."}, {"text": "Your main concern over the next six months must be to get your financial house in order. If you can do that then the six months after that should be free of the kind of money worries that have been holding you back. Then your creativity will soar."}, {"text": "Over the next few days you will find that your thinking takes on a deeper dimension as mind planet Mercury introduces you to ideas that may not have occurred to you before. There can be no more limiting the way you look at the world."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to tell a friend or loved one what you think they want to hear today but you won\u2019t do them, nor yourself, any favours in the long-term. Be honest and let them know what you really think about their recent behaviour."}, {"text": "If you have fallen out with someone close then you can quite easily kiss and make up over the next 24 hours. Mercury in the relationship area of your chart will help you find the right words to convey how much you regret any misunderstandings."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t push yourself harder than you need to over the next few days. Most likely you can get everything that needs to be done completed with a minimum of fuss, and a minimum of physical effort, simply by using your head."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let other people waste your precious time. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart means you need to focus all your energy \u2013 mental, physical and emotional \u2013 on things that mean something to you personally. Be a bit selfish."}, {"text": "If someone seems to be getting the better of an argument you\u2019ve been having with them it could be because they know more about the subject under discussion than you do. You may have to admit that you were wrong. It\u2019s not the end of the world."}, {"text": "Not everyone can live up to your high standards Libra, so be ready to make allowances over the next 24 hours and don\u2019t make a fuss if a colleague falls short of what you were hoping from them. They still have other talents you can use."}, {"text": "Pay attention only to those things that genuinely matter to you, as opposed to the things that other people say should matter to you. You cannot change the world, nor should you want to, but you can change yourself for the better."}, {"text": "As Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving through your birth sign you will begin to understand how much effort and energy you have wasted on things that are irrelevant to your life goals. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s still plenty of time to get it right."}, {"text": "You seem a bit subdued at the moment but that\u2019s okay. According to the planets you have lots to think about and the best way to do that is to put up barriers between yourself and the rest of the world. Make sure they are only temporary though."}, {"text": "You have never been afraid to speak your mind but today you should take a more relaxed attitude towards people who think, feel and act in ways you may not agree with. After all, it takes all sorts to make a world \u2013 yes, even Aquarians!"}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your professional status means you can make a big impression on employers and other authority figures. If you think your talents are being overlooked then now is the time to speak up about it."}, {"text": "You may have to do something over the coming months that you don\u2019t much enjoy but your sense of duty will prevail and you will do it to the best of your abilities. Your efforts won\u2019t go unnoticed. Someone in authority will reward you handsomely."}, {"text": "Keep your overall goal in mind but don\u2019t be too rigid in your thinking as to how you are going to reach it. The path that will take you most directly toward your objective is not necessarily the best one. The scenic route could be more interesting."}, {"text": "The planets warn that while you have the power to make things happen you must not misuse your authority. If you do you may suffer some kind of setback. Whatever it is you desire today you must attain it through fair means only."}, {"text": "Try not to get so caught up in other people\u2019s worries and woes that you lose sight of the fact that the world is still a wonderful place. Steer clear of negative people and situations that are unlikely to end in smiles. Always be positive."}, {"text": "It might be a smart move to keep your thoughts and opinions to yourself today, especially if they go against the grain of what the powers that be regard as acceptable. There will be a time to speak up but that time is not yet."}, {"text": "You must make allowances for those who don\u2019t share your drive and determination to get things done. The world is full of all kinds of people and each and every one of them has an important role to play. Your aims don\u2019t have to be their aims."}, {"text": "If you are having second thoughts about a plan or project of some kind it could be because you are secretly worried that you are not prepared to start on it yet. In which case just change your timetable. It\u2019s your baby after all."}, {"text": "Too often of late you have wasted time looking back and wondering what might have been, when what you should have been doing is looking forward and imagining what life will be like when all your dreams come true. Change your thinking Libra!"}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to be plagued by self-doubt so why are your thoughts up in the air at the moment? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it and get moving again. Any direction will do, just so long as you are on the move."}, {"text": "The more certain people criticize your choices the more you can be sure they are the right choices for you. If you encounter opposition today \u2013 and you will \u2013 it can only be because others sense you are going to succeed where they failed."}, {"text": "No doubt there are many things in the world that need changing but don\u2019t start thinking you can do it all on your own. In fact, you need to get out of the habit of believing you have a duty to always get involved. Charity begins at home."}, {"text": "Stick to the script today, because if you cut corners or do things in ways authority figures don\u2019t agree with you could find yourself having to do it all over again. It may be a pain having to play it straight but it\u2019s safer for the time being."}, {"text": "The more certain people say you can trust them the tighter you should hold on to your wallet. Just because they have a way with words does not mean their words can be trusted and the planets warn that what you hear today could be deceptive."}, {"text": "There will be times over the coming year when it feels as if events are slipping away from you, that you have lost control and can\u2019t get it back again. But that\u2019s okay \u2013 in fact it\u2019s good. Letting go is the key to success and to enjoying life more."}, {"text": "You may get emotional about something today that 99 per cent of the time would not bother you in the slightest. Try not to let your feelings get in the way of common sense \u2013 yes, it is possible for them to exist side by side."}, {"text": "If you feel the need to let off steam then do so and don\u2019t feel in the least bit guilty about it. Sometimes you hold your feelings in too much and then, at some stage, an emotional explosion results. You seem close to that position now."}, {"text": "Try not to take anything too seriously over the next 24 hours, especially where your career is concerned. There is no point getting angry if things don\u2019t work out the way you expected. Accept the situation for what it is and find ways to work with it."}, {"text": "More than most other signs you can be affected by your emotions and today\u2019s cosmic picture warns if you let your feelings get the better of you it could cause problems further down the line. Try to be a bit more logical in your thinking."}, {"text": "The grass may look greener on the other side of the fence but you should be smart enough to know that from over there the view is probably no different. Instead of wanting what you cannot have, learn to love what you do have."}, {"text": "You may sympathize with a loved one\u2019s plight but it is not up to you to put things right for them. Let them work out their own solution and don\u2019t do any more than offer the occasional hint. They must learn to stand on their own two feet."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t have to feel guilty just because you don\u2019t get along with a certain individual. Yes, it would be nice if you were on the same wavelength but quite clearly you are not, so keep a space between you so you\u2019re less likely to clash."}, {"text": "It may seem to others that you\u2019ve been lucky and that the good things coming your way are not deserved, but that is not the full story. What goes around always comes around eventually, so you must have done something at some time to deserve it."}, {"text": "It may be tempting to come down to someone else\u2019s level and argue with them in ways they can more readily understand but don\u2019t do it. You are not the one who needs to change. Nor are you a trivial person, so don\u2019t say trivial things."}, {"text": "You need to let others know that you will never accept less than what you believe you are worth. Your talents are such that you are right to demand top dollar for them, today and every day. The planets indicate you won\u2019t be short of buyers."}, {"text": "Whatever else you do today don\u2019t push yourself too hard. The cosmic set-up is such that the more you exert yourself over the next 24 hours the less you are likely to accomplish. Give yourself some breathing space and take life as it comes."}, {"text": "If you decide to do something on the spur of the moment today it will turn out to be a lot of fun, although not everyone will approve of what you are up to. But, of course, you\u2019re a Pisces and being different comes easily to you."}, {"text": "Creatively and artistically this should be a year to remember. You must have a project or two that is close to your heart, and now is the time to stop toying with it and get serious about seeing it through to completion. Fame and fortune beckon!"}, {"text": "What happens today may not be entirely to your liking but if you stay calm and stay switched on it\u2019s unlikely you will lose out. If the pressure is on all of a sudden you must not panic. Tackle what comes at you one thing at a time."}, {"text": "You know there are times when there is no point trying to force events, and this is clearly one of them. If you find yourself stuck and unable to move ahead, don\u2019t get annoyed \u2013 just accept the situation and find ways to make the best of it."}, {"text": "Something will happen today that makes you wish you had been a bit less impulsive, especially in your dealings with people in positions of power. You may have to admit that you got it wrong but if you don\u2019t your reputation could suffer lasting harm."}, {"text": "The planets warn that anything you begin on impulse over the next few days could get you into hot water. Will that stop you? Of course not. You\u2019re in one of those moods when you just don\u2019t care. And with Mars on your side you\u2019ll battle through."}, {"text": "Once you make up your mind about something it takes a lot to make you change it again. Having said which, you can now see that a financial decision you took a few weeks ago was more than just a little bit wrong. There\u2019s still time to change it."}, {"text": "No matter how hard you try to convince someone that you know what you are doing they will refuse to believe you. So stop talking about it and just get on it with. As is so often the case, actions will speak louder than words."}, {"text": "At some stage over the next few days you will come to the conclusion that you are doing too many things for too many people. Then, of course, you must do something about it. Be ruthless \u2013 cut back on your commitments by at least 50 per cent."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste time trying to explain what you are doing \u2013 the only thing that matters is that you do it right now, this very moment. Generally speaking, people are more impressed by those who take action than by those who just talk about it."}, {"text": "You have changed your mind so many times about a highly personal issue that it seems to have become a bit of a habit. That needs to stop. Make a commitment to stick with a certain course of action, then see it through to the end."}, {"text": "As usual you will be rushing around trying to get a dozen things done at once, but that\u2019s okay. You have so much energy at your disposal now that it\u2019s pointless trying to contain it. You\u2019ll get more done today than you usually get done in a week."}, {"text": "Why are you worrying so much about your money situation? Yes, it\u2019s true, it could be better but with Mars now moving into the main financial area of your chart you can find ways to improve your cash-flow situation. Try spending less too!"}, {"text": "As Mars moves into your birth sign today you may be tempted to do something out of the ordinary, which is fine. But make sure it\u2019s not the kind of something that could get you in trouble with the powers that be. The law applies to you too!"}, {"text": "Love planet Venus is going to be the main influence on your life over the coming year and that bodes well for affairs of the heart. Venus is also the planet of values, so give some thought to what you appreciate most in life \u2013 then get more of it."}, {"text": "This should be a fun time for affairs of the heart, so put money and other worries out of your head and focus only on enjoying yourself with the people who mean most to you. Relationships of all kinds will go well over the next few days."}, {"text": "You always seem to be on the go, and that\u2019s fine, but today you would be wise to slow right down and give both your body and your mind time to recuperate. You\u2019ve been through a lot in recent weeks and need to restore some balance."}, {"text": "The planets are now urging you to make more of an effort to work with people who share your aims and ambitions in life. There is a lot you can do on your own but there is no limit to what you can do as part of a team."}, {"text": "If a friend needs a shoulder to cry on today you are the one who will give it to them. It may be true that they brought their troubles on themselves but it is not your place to criticize. Remind the world how sympathetic a sign Cancer can be."}, {"text": "You will be in the mood for pleasure today and you must not let anything hold you back from indulging yourself to the full. Whatever outstanding duties and responsibilities you may have you are advised to ignore them all and have fun."}, {"text": "You seem to have got so deeply involved in a project of some kind that you have become oblivious to another matter that needs to be dealt with. Stand back from yourself today and try to get a wider perspective on what is important."}, {"text": "As Venus, your ruler, moves in your favour again today you won\u2019t be minded to push yourself too hard \u2013 and indeed, why should you? What\u2019s done is done and cannot be undone, so you might as well relax and get a bit more enjoyment from life."}, {"text": "Venus in the most sensitive area of your chart may be making you a bit more moody than usual but it is also making you aware that other people have problems too. By helping someone in need today you will be helping yourself as well."}, {"text": "No, the world is not out to get you. No, you are not the victim of a conspiracy. For some reason you have allowed your imagination to run riot of late and now you seem to believe all sorts of weird and wonderful things \u2013 none of which are true!"}, {"text": "As Venus, planet of harmony, moves in your favour today you should find it quite easy to make a good impression on those around you. Whatever it is you are currently working on, do it with passion and commitment, plus a large dash of style."}, {"text": "You will be full of good cheer today and most likely won\u2019t have the foggiest idea why. But why should there be a reason? Why can\u2019t you just enjoy life for the sake of it? You can, and you will, and the world will love you for it."}, {"text": "According to the planets you recently developed a crush on someone, a romantic attraction which, for one reason or another, is unlikely to bring you happiness. Keep your feelings strictly to yourself. This is the wrong time to be honest about them."}, {"text": "You need to expand your horizons this year. For too long you have narrowed your focus to such an extent that, while it has brought you considerable success, you have begun to miss important signs along the way \u2013 signs you are supposed to follow."}, {"text": "If you let your emotions get in the way of logical thinking this weekend you could end up a very long way from the truth. And if you see plots and conspiracies around every corner it\u2019s a sure sign your imagination is playing tricks on you."}, {"text": "Do something that excites you this weekend, even if it is something that does not meet with general approval. You\u2019re a Taurus and you don\u2019t do things to please other people, not even those you are closest to emotionally. Always please yourself first."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t expect your carefully worked out plans and routines to run smoothly over the next 48 hours. In fact they may fall apart completely. But do you really need your life to be so regimented and so organized? Probably not. Let go and live!"}, {"text": "It may seem as if everyone but you has taken leave of their senses but you should know by now that the world does not always turn in a logical way. Maybe that\u2019s the real problem \u2013 maybe it\u2019s you who is expecting too much. Think about it."}, {"text": "There is no point trying to reason with people today, because others are guaranteed to disagree with everything you say. You could try to double bluff them and say the opposite of what you mean, but is it worth the effort? No it isn\u2019t."}, {"text": "It may seem to some that the world is going to hell in a handcart but you can choose not to look at it that way. Keep smiling and keep believing that things will get better, and chances are they will very soon, for you at least."}, {"text": "Try not to let other people\u2019s selfishness and stupidity get to you over the next few days. Ignore what they say and ignore what they do and keep faith with the path that you have chosen to take. Rise above petty things, and petty people."}, {"text": "If you don\u2019t feel like being creative this weekend then don\u2019t force yourself. According to the planets there is not much point trying to start anything new at the moment \u2013 but you can, and you should, finish what you have already begun."}, {"text": "You are spending too much time looking back and thinking about what might have been and need to snap yourself out of it. In a matter of days the sun will move in your favour and a new phase will begin. The past will soon be ancient history."}, {"text": "Honesty is, of course, a virtue but there are still occasions when you should keep your thoughts to yourself and this is one of them. Even if a loved one demands to know what you think about their plans you would be wise to lie, a little."}, {"text": "Employers and other important people have been hugely demanding of late and, for the most part, you have managed to raise your game and impress them. But you know there is one more thing you need to do to enhance your reputation. Do it now."}, {"text": "It may be tempting to act outrageously this weekend, if only because you realize you may not get another chance for quite some time, but stay within the bounds of what is socially acceptable. Yes, rules can be tedious, but they are there for a reason."}, {"text": "The coming 12 months may not be as disruptive as the previous 12 months but there will still be momentous changes. The good thing is you finally know what it is you want most out of life, which makes getting it so much easier. Be sensational Scorpio!"}, {"text": "If a friend or colleague has a great idea today it\u2019s quite likely that you will be jealous. But is there some way you can make it pay for you as well? Just because it\u2019s their idea does not mean you cannot adapt it for your own purposes."}, {"text": "Having boasted to everyone within earshot what you intend to do, it might be wise to actually get on with it. Some of your rivals seem to think you are all talk and no action, and the longer you put it off the more people will agree with them."}, {"text": "If there is something that needs to be cut out of your life then you will get the chance over the next few weeks. Mars in your opposite sign as from tomorrow will give you the ruthlessness you need to wield the axe. Leave no room for sentiment."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to push yourself harder than ever to get something finished but if you do you could exhaust yourself and end up even further behind than before. Plan what you have to do so it gets done by the end of the week, no earlier."}, {"text": "Whatever you choose to start this week will take up a great deal of time and energy, so make sure it is what you really want to be doing and, once you have committed to it, go all the way. No, it won\u2019t be too much for you."}, {"text": "With Mars about to move into the domestic area of your chart you must expect a certain amount of challenging behaviour from partners and loved ones. Calm them down as best you can but, if it gets too much, don\u2019t be afraid to lay down the law."}, {"text": "As Mars is about to move into the most outspoken area of your chart you won\u2019t be shy about telling people what you think \u2013 loudly if necessary. Just bear in mind that if your message is a good one you should not have to shriek about it."}, {"text": "By all means work hard and have fun this week, but start looking for ways you can wind down a bit too. Mars is about to leave your sign, so your energy levels may dip a little over the next few days. It\u2019s quite natural, so don\u2019t fight it."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to lack in self-belief but recent weeks have seen you questioning both your motives and abilities. Don\u2019t worry, not long after Mars enters your sign tomorrow your confidence will come surging back. You will soon be your old self again."}, {"text": "You may have to work on something you don\u2019t much enjoy today but if you knuckle down and show willingness, and make a good job of it, then it won\u2019t be as bad as you feared. Attitude is everything, so be positive and take pride in what you do."}, {"text": "Something will happen over the next 48 hours that forces you to face up to the fact that you need to make major changes on the work front. The world outside your door has been changing, so now you must change too to keep pace with it."}, {"text": "Yes, a rival has more power than you, but you have more brains, so you should be able to take what occurs over the next few days and shape it to your advantage. But don\u2019t just wait for things to happen, seize the initiative and make them happen."}, {"text": "As a Scorpio you have a tendency to go to extremes but that will be tempered over the coming year by the understanding that you need to forge alliances with like-minded people. Don\u2019t be so fixed in your opinions \u2013 it\u2019s okay to bend a little at times."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if you find yourself with your back to the wall over the next few days \u2013 you are the kind of person who likes to be challenged. Dive into your Aries reserves of courage and confidence and find ways to resolve the situation."}, {"text": "No matter how impatient you may be to get started on a new project you must take your time and get the details right. Even if you truly believe that nothing can possibly go wrong, you are still advised to take it slowly at first."}, {"text": "Someone in a position of power will provoke you outrageously today and you will find it hard not to react. Most likely that is what they want you to do because it will give them an excuse to come down on you hard. Don\u2019t fall for it."}, {"text": "The more other people agree with each other the more you will suspect that they are up to something. Maybe it\u2019s just your suspicious nature working overtime but the planets suggest you could be right, so decline to go along with their plans, for now."}, {"text": "There may seem to be no logical reason for what happens today but why should logic have anything to do with it? You\u2019re dealing with people, real human beings, not figures on a page, and very few people know what their own minds are up to."}, {"text": "Yes, what you are working on with other people is boring, but you are advised to stick with it for a while longer. What happens around the time of Friday\u2019s full moon will bring new opportunities \u2013 then and only then should you revise your plans."}, {"text": "You know the old saying: If you want a job done well then you should do it yourself. That seems to be very much the case as the new week begins \u2013 don\u2019t delegate tasks to people who don\u2019t possess half your drive and dynamism."}, {"text": "You have a tendency to stir up trouble with some of the things you say and today will be no different. It won\u2019t worry you in the slightest, of course, but watch your back because more than a few people will be looking for ways to damage you."}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to back down when challenged and you are not about to start now. That\u2019s fine, but bear in mind that the upcoming full moon could tip the odds against you toward the end of the week. Don\u2019t make enemies needlessly."}, {"text": "What happens over the next few days is likely to disrupt your schedule and send your plans all over the place, which won\u2019t be to your liking. What will be to your liking though is that new opportunities will arise from the chaos. Be ready for them."}, {"text": "The best way to help other people is to leave well alone and let them sort out their own problems. That might sound cold-hearted but the fact is certain individuals have been relying on you too much. It\u2019s time they took responsibility for themselves."}, {"text": "As the sun nears the end of its stay in one of the better areas of your chart you will need to tighten up how you do things and not be quite so careless and easygoing. Think of your reputation and how you can both maintain and improve it."}, {"text": "Energy planet Mars and enthusiasm planet Jupiter form a powerful link on your birthday, which among other things means you will be in the mood to take risks. Make sure you know what the risks are though. You\u2019re not invincible!"}, {"text": "If you receive more than you think you deserve today there must be a good reason for it. Most likely you did a good deed for someone in the recent past that you have forgotten about \u2013 but luckily for you the universe never forgets."}, {"text": "Ignore those who say the world is coming to an end and just get on and enjoy your life. The fact is that you personally, and many of the people you know, have never had it so good, so why worry? A positive attitude is a must."}, {"text": "The more your ambitions have been frustrated in recent weeks the more determined you will be to taste success in the future. But the future, of course, begins today, so ask yourself: what can you do to make this the best day ever?"}, {"text": "If you want to move up in the world, if you want to make a name for yourself, now is the time to make your play and see if you can grab the attention of the kind of people who can assist you. Success is always a team game."}, {"text": "The things that you valued yesterday won\u2019t be the same things that you value tomorrow, so it is important that you stay mentally flexible and physically ready to move in a new direction. Big opportunities are coming. Don\u2019t miss them!"}, {"text": "Someone you usually see as a rival will surprise you today by offering to co-operate with you. Can you trust them? Most likely you can but be on your guard anyway, just in case. There is certainly no cosmic reason why you cannot be friends."}, {"text": "What takes place over the next 24 hours will finally convince you of something you did not want to be convinced of: that what you have been working on these past few weeks was a waste of time. Never mind. All experience is good experience."}, {"text": "You may not be the most expressive member of the zodiac but you have your moments and today you will let someone know just how much they mean to you. Chances are they know already, but it\u2019s always nice to be reminded!"}, {"text": "If someone has been telling tales about you then by all means cut them out of your circle of friends. But make sure you know all the facts of the situation before doing something so drastic. Maybe someone else is spreading lies about you both."}, {"text": "Put your chores to one side for a while and have some fun. The more you get out and meet people who know how to smile the more likely it is you will soon be feeling better about yourself \u2013 not that you should be feeling bad at all!"}, {"text": "Try not to be too pushy today, especially where money matters are concerned. A powerful Mars-Jupiter link warns you may not be in as strong a position as you seem to think you are. Yes, there are bigger sharks in the sea, so watch out."}, {"text": "Your determination to make something of yourself will soar today as Mars in your sign makes you believe that all things are possible. Indeed they are but don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that you have to do everything, Be selective in your ambitions."}, {"text": "Uranus, planet of upheaval, is strong on your birthday this year, so you will face situations that require you to live by your wits, especially on the work front where changes are imminent. Ultimately all change is good change, so be brave and be bold."}, {"text": "One of the very best times of the year for you begins tomorrow when the sun moves in your favour. If nothing else you will notice that those vague worries you had about this and about that quickly disappear. They were, after all, really about nothing."}, {"text": "Once again certain individuals seem determined to avoid giving you a straight answer to the simplest of questions. It may be annoying but chances are they really don\u2019t know the answer and hounding them about it won\u2019t do any good."}, {"text": "You need to be more open about your feelings. If you can let others know how much you care it will make so many other things much easier. They find it hard enough to read your mind, so how can you expect them to know what\u2019s in your heart?"}, {"text": "Little things can mean a lot and something small scale and seemingly trivial will take on meaning out of all proportion to its size today. Don\u2019t ignore it or try to pass responsibility to someone else \u2013 the universe wants you to take care of it."}, {"text": "One of the most promising times of the year is about to begin and if you are to make the most of it the first thing you must do is put the past firmly behind you. Forget about getting even with people \u2013 your task now is to get ahead."}, {"text": "You will get the chance to prove your critics wrong today, but is it worth the effort? The planets suggest you will do better in the long-term if you focus on what is of true significance now, and petty feuds are not remotely important."}, {"text": "Very soon you will be able to go where you want to go and do what you want to do, but for the time being you should take it easy and conserve your energy and resources. Timing is everything and the right time is not quite yet."}, {"text": "Your view of reality may have become a bit distorted in recent weeks but what happens over the next few days will make it abundantly clear where you went wrong and why. Don\u2019t be angry with yourself \u2013 even Scorpios go astray occasionally."}, {"text": "You have put yourself to the test in recent weeks and no doubt come through with flying colours. The sun\u2019s move into your sign tomorrow marks the start of a major new phase, one in which what you learned from those tests makes a huge difference."}, {"text": "There will be times over the next few days when you require nothing more than to be left alone \u2013 which, inevitably, means everyone will want to get close to you. Find a way to cut yourself off that does not offend too many people."}, {"text": "If a project you have been working on has not reached the stage you hoped it would reach by now don\u2019t force it. Today\u2019s sun-Uranus link warns if you try too hard you could end up breaking something. There will be other opportunities to complete it."}, {"text": "If you have not given much thought to your status in recent months then what occurs over the next few days will nudge you to start thinking about it. How could you benefit the world by improving your position in it? Think about it, then act."}, {"text": "As you were born on the cusp of two signs you sometimes find it hard deciding what it is you want from life. However, the events of the past 12 months have pointed you firmly in one particular direction. Don\u2019t hesitate over the next 12 months \u2013 go for it!"}, {"text": "As the sun moves into the most adventurous area of your chart today it won\u2019t be long before you find a new sense of direction and a new motivation. Most importantly, you will no longer allow minor doubts and fears to hold you back. Get going Aries!"}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you make sure those who have been holding you back know that as from today you intend to call the shots, at least as far as your own affairs are concerned. And don\u2019t just say it Taurus \u2013 mean it!"}, {"text": "Do you act on what common sense tells you or do you act on what other people tell you? It must, of course, be the former, although that does not mean you should not take the views of partners into account. Just don\u2019t let them count too much."}, {"text": "As the sun changes signs today you will feel a new sense of urgency, especially where your work is concerned. However, it would be a mistake to just throw yourself at life any old how. What\u2019s your plan? If you don\u2019t have one, then get one!"}, {"text": "The sun\u2019s move into your fellow fire sign of Sagittarius today marks the start of one of the best times of the year for you. Over the next three or four weeks you will get several opportunities to do amazing things. Make good use of them all."}, {"text": "Some kind of upset or upheaval is likely either today or tomorrow, most likely on the home front, but try not to think of it as bad news. The fact is that things do need to change, maybe quite radically, so be thankful and be ready to act."}, {"text": "According to the planets you may come into money over the next few days, but they also warn that what you gain could be lost in an instant if you don\u2019t impose some financial self-control on yourself. \u201cEasy come, easy go\u201d is not a great philosophy."}, {"text": "The sun now moves into the area of your chart that governs what you own and earn and the very first thing you need to do is to draw up a profit and loss account for the past few weeks. You may need to plug some financial gaps."}, {"text": "Your luck is very much on the turn now the sun is moving into your own sign but don\u2019t get carried away. The fact is you rarely get something for nothing in life, so look ahead and make plans \u2013 and make sure they are plans that will work."}, {"text": "Your confidence may dip a little today but it\u2019s nothing to be worried about. It\u2019s quite natural at this time of year, as the sun begins its journey through the most sensitive area of your chart, to feel a bit down. You\u2019ll bounce back though \u2013 you always do."}, {"text": "You will be in the mood to start something new today but if you are smart you will wait until the beginning of next week before making concrete plans. Tomorrow\u2019s full moon could be a disruptive influence, so don\u2019t tie yourself down just yet."}, {"text": "The time has come to let those you live and work with \u2013 especially the latter \u2013 know where you are coming from and where you intend to go between now and the end of the year. Don\u2019t let anyone undermine your ambitions. Be positive Pisces!"}, {"text": "A full moon on your birthday suggests that your loyalties will be pulled in opposite directions over the coming 12 months. It\u2019s good of you to want the best for someone who has helped you in the past but it\u2019s your future you must think about first."}, {"text": "This is not a time to make hasty decisions, not with a full moon making you even more impetuous than you normally are. Remember too that just because you think something does not mean you are obliged to say it \u2013 though you probably will."}, {"text": "There may be times over the next 24 hours when it feels as if you are out of your depth but you must not give up. It may be an uncomfortable experience but it is also a learning experience, one from which you will emerge mentally stronger."}, {"text": "A full moon in your sign is likely to make you rather emotional today, even if you are the sort of Gemini who usually manages to control your feelings. Just this once it\u2019s okay to let it all out, so shout and scream if it makes you feel better!"}, {"text": "You may have made up your mind about something but the planets warn you will have to change it again either today or tomorrow. Don\u2019t try to delay the inevitable \u2013 you know you made a wrong move, so now you need to put it right."}, {"text": "You probably don\u2019t care in the slightest if others approve or disapprove of what you are doing but the full moon warns that kind of attitude could be your undoing. Listen to what others have to tell you today \u2013 they might actually save you from yourself."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t be able to control what happens today, either in your personal life or on the work front, so go with the flow and hope it does not take you some place you have a hard time getting back from. If you can adapt then you\u2019ll survive."}, {"text": "You may have your suspicions about someone but it might be wise not to go public with them today. There is a good chance you have got the wrong end of the stick and, if you do say something now, you could look rather foolish later on."}, {"text": "You need to take extreme care with your cash today because the cosmic picture is such that if you make a small financial mistake it could quickly and easily develop into a large one \u2013 and you know how much you hate losing money."}, {"text": "No matter what efforts you make to get on with a partner or loved one today they won\u2019t want to know, so you might as well do as you please and not worry too much about the consequences. This time tomorrow everything will be back to normal."}, {"text": "If you find that you are struggling to stay on top of your workload then you will need to swallow your pride and ask for assistance. The simple fact is you took on too much too quickly and now you must pay the price. But you\u2019ll survive."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s full moon in the sympathetic sign of Gemini brings with it a lot of creative potential but for best results you must get past the idea that you can do it all on your own. If a project is worth doing then do it with like-minded people."}, {"text": "Because today\u2019s full moon cuts across such an important angle of your chart you must be on your guard at all times both at home and at work. If certain people get sky high emotionally it may fall to you to talk them down again."}, {"text": "Sometimes it all gets a bit much and you wonder if maybe you would be happier with less in your life \u2013 less possessions, less people, less responsibilities. You\u2019ll be feeling that way a lot over the coming year. Streamline your lifestyle as much as you can."}, {"text": "This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you and you should already be feeling more confident about your prospects. Don't be afraid to express your opinions, however radical they might be. You are now in a position to change things."}, {"text": "Let friends and loved ones know if you want to be left alone this weekend. You like to be sociable, of course, but right now you want nothing more than to spend a bit of time by yourself. Your own good company is enough for now."}, {"text": "Partnerships and relationships are more important than ever now, so if you have fallen out with someone close over the past few weeks now is the perfect time to kiss and make up. Even if the break wasn\u2019t your fault, be the first to say \u201csorry\u201d."}, {"text": "The old ways may be annoying but that does not mean you should throw the past in the garbage can and start again from scratch. If that is how you are feeling at the moment you need to get a grip on yourself. Evolution is better than revolution."}, {"text": "You will soon recover from whatever shock yesterday\u2019s full moon brought your way, but hopefully it will have reminded you never to take anything for granted. With that thought in mind, make the most of the good things that come your way this weekend."}, {"text": "Your family must come first over the next 48 hours, even if you want nothing more than to pursue an aim or ambition that requires 100 per cent of your focus. Your work can wait but those you love cannot. Put feelings before fame and fortune."}, {"text": "A number of things that previously made no sense are beginning to fall into place and by the start of next week you should have a clear idea of what is going on and, more importantly, where you fit into the picture. Most likely right at the centre."}, {"text": "Friends and co-workers will offer to do things for you this weekend but if you are smart you will thank them and just do them yourself. You know from long experience that few people share either your drive or your quest for perfection."}, {"text": "You will have a lot to say for yourself over the next 48 hours and not everyone will be happy about it. Will that worry you? Of course not. You have never been one to care much what other people think and you\u2019re in no mood to change now!"}, {"text": "This is a frustrating time for you in that there are so many things you want to do but you seem unable to get on with them. Perhaps you should take the cosmic hint and stop making plans and setting deadlines. You\u2019re allowed to relax Capricorn!"}, {"text": "The world needs people who are not afraid to speak up, and that means the world needs people like you. However, just because you have something to say does not mean it is correct. Try listening to alternative opinions. You may learn something."}, {"text": "You must expect to be in the public eye more now that the sun is moving through the career area of your chart. That idea probably doesn\u2019t excite you too much but if you put yourself about over the next few days the returns will be worth it."}, {"text": "There is a fine line between being sure of yourself and being cocky and if you can keep just the right side of that line over the next few months you will accomplish some remarkable things. Be larger-than-life, but not so large that you put people off."}, {"text": "The approaching new moon in your fellow fire sign of Sagittarius makes this the ideal time to spread your wings and liven things up a bit. If you get the urge to travel don\u2019t fight it \u2013 just go where the wanderlust takes you and enjoy every minute."}, {"text": "You have never been the sort to cash in an investment too early and you are not about to start now. If you hold on to something of value a bit longer you may find that its worth soars. The markets are operating very much in your favour now."}, {"text": "As tomorrow\u2019s new moon falls in your opposite sign of Sagittarius it would be wise to accept a secondary position if that is all you are offered. You don\u2019t have to be the one in the spotlight all the time \u2013 supporting roles are often important too."}, {"text": "However attractive a deal may seem there is danger you will agree to it too quickly, thus giving others the impression that they can easily offer you less in future. Hold out for more, even if you are quite happy with it. Always know your own worth."}, {"text": "Your creative juices have started to stir and it won\u2019t be long before you are deeply involved in an artistic project of some kind. Don\u2019t try to keep your ideas to yourself though \u2013 get friends and family members involved. Their input could make a huge difference."}, {"text": "If you have been trying to avoid dealing an emotional problem then tomorrow\u2019s new moon will compel you to face up to it at last. Say what you have to say and do what you have do, and don\u2019t worry that you might upset a few people."}, {"text": "There are so many cosmic influences working in your favour at the moment that you must take advantage of them. Above all this week you should be on the move. It would be a crime to stay at home and miss out on what\u2019s going on in the world."}, {"text": "A financial incentive of some kind will be offered to you over the next two or three days and while it may be attractive you must think carefully before you accept. Will what you are asked to do to earn the money fit in with your long-term plans?"}, {"text": "Tomorrow\u2019s new moon will give you the confidence to reach out and take what you most desire. If you are still unclear about what it is you should be aiming for then give it some serious thought over the next 24 hours. Don\u2019t let indecision hold you back."}, {"text": "You generally like to trust people but there are some individuals who set off mental alarms every time you have to deal with them. One such person needs to be watched very carefully today. Don\u2019t give them a say in anything that is important to you."}, {"text": "You are no longer willing to accept rules and regulations just because someone in a position of power says that you should. Good for you. But try not to make waves just for the fun of it over the next few days. Don\u2019t just be rebellious \u2013 be constructive too."}, {"text": "If you have not been getting the respect you deserve on the work front then by all means kick up a fuss. The approaching new moon will encourage you to get tough with people who seem to have an inflated sense of their own importance."}, {"text": "Jupiter, your ruler, really sparkles on your birthday this year and if you are smart you will use the charisma it gives you to improve your status both at home and at work. Always be positive and always find reasons to laugh. That won\u2019t be hard at all."}, {"text": "Most people will look kindly on you today and you are advised to make the most of it. Even when you are out of order you will most likely be forgiven, thanks to the influence of Jupiter in your chart. That\u2019s not an invitation to go mad though!"}, {"text": "Your words and actions will annoy certain people today \u2013 and you won\u2019t care in the slightest. It seems you are in one of those moods where the whole world could be against you and you would not care one little bit. Sticking your neck out can be fun!"}, {"text": "Try to be forgiving with someone you have held a grudge against for some time. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign indicates that if you are good to them now they will be good to you later on \u2013 and on balance you\u2019ll come out of it best."}, {"text": "If you want to be productive and show how capable a Cancer you can be then try doing something a little bit different. If you go over the same old ground in the same old way you will simply get the same old results and that won\u2019t impress anyone."}, {"text": "If you know what it is you want out of life then today\u2019s sun-Jupiter link will bring it much closer. And if you don\u2019t know what you want? Then sit yourself down in a quiet place and think deeply about what your destiny should be. Then act."}, {"text": "According to the planets you are not thinking big enough and you are not setting yourself the kind of challenging goals that will bring out the best in you. Don\u2019t opt for the easy life Virgo, make it your aim to achieve something every day of your life."}, {"text": "Once again you seem to be worrying about things that most likely will never happen and you need to get over it and then get on with making the most of your talents \u2013 one of which is your ability to communicate with all sorts of people."}, {"text": "Yes, of course, if someone tells you something you don\u2019t want to hear you can just close your ears and ignore it. But the planets warn if you do that you may miss something that could transform your existence. Be more open to advice Scorpio."}, {"text": "As the sun links with Jupiter in your sign today everything will fall into place and you will start to believe that the universe is your friend again. Actually it\u2019s always been your friend but sometimes you shut yourself off from it too easily."}, {"text": "Saturn in your sign brings all sorts of challenges but it also rewards you when you make an effort to raise your game. If you make such an effort today you will gain in ways that delight you, and no one will say you do not deserve it."}, {"text": "You have never been one to back down from confrontation and that\u2019s good but you must not allow yourself to believe that every minor disagreement is a battle of life and death. Try to be a bit more mellow today \u2013 the results will amaze you."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry too much if someone you work with tries to pick holes in what you are doing because it means you are doing something right. Most likely they are jealous that you are moving ahead while they are still stuck in the past."}, {"text": "Because you are such an easygoing character you often waste time and energy on things, and people, that are not really worth it. Over the coming year you can and you must be more ruthless. Above all, learn to say \u201cNo\u201d \u2013 and mean it!"}, {"text": "This is by any measure one of the best times of the year for you but that is not an invitation to throw caution to the wind. Today\u2019s Mars-Saturn link means you can get a huge amount done, but you must be careful and you must plan ahead."}, {"text": "You need to get serious about what you own and earn, not least because the sun\u2019s journey through the wealth area of your chart makes it easy to both make money and lose it. Remember, wealth is a means to an end, not an end in itself."}, {"text": "Some people can be incredibly demanding and because there is so much cosmic activity at the opposite end of your chart most of their demands seem to be aimed at you. Do what you can to help them but don\u2019t ever agree to do it all."}, {"text": "If you start something new it may not work out the way you had hoped but, yes, it is still worth doing. For best results, take it a step at a time and don\u2019t expect too much of yourself \u2013 then every small gain will seem like a major victory."}, {"text": "The atmosphere on the home front may not have been the best in recent weeks but by now you should be seeing a thaw in relationships that have become more than a little frosty of late. Do your part by being warmer and more open too."}, {"text": "With both the sun and Jupiter linking to your ruling planet Mercury today you won\u2019t hesitate to let those around you know what is on your mind. Hopefully it will be positive but, even if it isn\u2019t, your words will have the desired effect."}, {"text": "You may be anxious about a certain situation but worrying about it won\u2019t make any difference at all, so take control of your feelings and make sure you act only in ways that make a positive result more likely. You can and you will succeed."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to look back and wish things had been different, so get past whatever it is that is having such a negative effect on your mind and start doing the things that make a positive future more likely. Get your act together Scorpio!"}, {"text": "More than most people you are aware that it\u2019s not whether you win or lose that matters but how you choose to play the game. Jupiter\u2019s link to mind planet Mercury today will do wonders for your attitude. Don\u2019t get too cocky though!"}, {"text": "The sun in your next door neighbor sign of Sagittarius means your solar year is coming to an end, making this a good time to take stock of how far you have come and how far you still need to go. What new targets will you set yourself?"}, {"text": "Your opinions on a certain subject are obviously very strong, and you are not the sort to tone them down to spare other people\u2019s feelings. Which is fine, but don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that some of those people might hit back at you. Are you prepared?"}, {"text": "With the sun moving through the career area of your chart you must be careful who you choose to rely on. Just because someone says they are your friend does not make it a fact. A little bit of suspicion is no bad thing at the moment."}, {"text": "Challenges are not designed to defeat you but to raise your game and find out what you are truly capable of. Life won\u2019t always be easy over the next 12 months but a year from now you will be a happier and more accomplished human being."}, {"text": "If someone is rude and confrontational for no good reason today then by all means be rude right back at them. Yes, there is a danger that the situation might spiral out of control, but your self-respect is at stake, making it a risk worth taking."}, {"text": "Be careful that you don\u2019t go too far and say too much today. Recognize too that although your words may not be bad in themselves the way you deliver them could irritate and upset certain people. You can be a bit blunt at times Taurus!"}, {"text": "Be wary of anyone who offers you the kind of deal that seems impossible to turn down. Before you accept you must do your homework and find out if they are really in a position to offer you so much for so little in return."}, {"text": "You can say what you want and do what you want but, of course, there will be consequences. Pluto in your opposite sign warns that not everyone thinks you are the best thing since sliced bread, so don\u2019t get carried away with yourself."}, {"text": "You have every right to believe what you want to believe but you also need to be aware that if your opinions are at odds with the accepted way of thinking then, of course, you will attract criticism. Will that worry you though? It\u2019s highly unlikely!"}, {"text": "Certain people have a knack for annoying and upsetting you and you must do what you can to avoid them today. But if you cannot avoid them then by all means make it plain what you think of their ideas \u2013 then turn around and walk away."}, {"text": "It\u2019s quite likely that someone you have dealings with will be less than complimentary about you today, but if you\u2019ve got any sense you will let their words fly over your head. Their opinions are irrelevant \u2013 it\u2019s what you think that counts."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t suffer fools at the best of times and one fool in particular is going to wish they had tried a bit harder to stay on your good side today. Having said which, don\u2019t be too tough on them \u2013 not everyone possesses your perfectionist nature."}, {"text": "In your hurry to dig your way out of a hole you have started digging a new one, and now you must stop what you are doing, stand back from the situation, and decide what your next move should be. Try filling in the holes and starting again."}, {"text": "If a friend says something a bit hurtful today don\u2019t get in a huff about it. Most likely they mean well but lack your ability to wrap up criticism in the kind of sugar coating that doesn\u2019t make it sound so bad. You\u2019re big enough to take it."}, {"text": "You are taking certain issues and certain people far too seriously and need to stand back a bit so you can see them for what they really are. Few things in life are worth getting worked up about to any great extent, so keep smiling."}, {"text": "What you have been given may not be what you were expecting, or what you wanted, but that\u2019s where you find yourself and all you can do now is make the best of it. If you are honest you will admit that you were probably expecting too much."}, {"text": "Ignore what other people say you should be doing and follow the dictates of your heart. You may not be able to explain, in a rational sense, why you have chosen a particular goal for the coming year but you know it\u2019s the right one for you."}, {"text": "It doesn\u2019t matter that almost everyone you deal with says you are biting off more than you can chew \u2013 you know that you can handle the situation, so go for it. There is no such word as \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d in the Aries vocabulary, not today, not any day!"}, {"text": "There is no point blaming yourself for some kind of mistake or mishap. The fact is you were not the only one involved so there is no reason why you should be the fall guy. As with success, failure should always be shared around."}, {"text": "You must seek assistance from people who know what they are doing. Yes, you can push ahead on your own if you like but if you do it will be a matter of hours before you reach some sort of mental or physical barrier. Get help!"}, {"text": "A work colleague is leading you a bit of a dance at the moment and you are getting close to the point where you might lose your temper. Chances are that\u2019s exactly what they are hoping will happen. It\u2019s an old trick \u2013 don\u2019t fall for it!"}, {"text": "You may be finding it hard to get a straight answer out of certain people but why let it bother you? You don\u2019t need to know what they are up to and still less do you need their opinion. Ignore them today and do your own thing."}, {"text": "Someone\u2019s dishonesty will take you by surprise today but if you had heeded the warnings of friends and colleagues it would not have come as such a shock. Now you know what they are really like you can take steps to avoid them."}, {"text": "You may not be pleased that someone is maybe a bit more vocal than necessary in their criticism of you but nevertheless what they say has relevance, so listen and learn to do better next time. But no, you don\u2019t have to thank them."}, {"text": "You are trying too hard to prove yourself to people who at most times of the year you would simply ignore. If you push yourself beyond your natural limits it could lead to failure, so slow down a bit and find your natural rhythm."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t let others talk you out of doing what you have set your heart on. Yes, some of their warnings may be valid but doubts and fears and obstacles are there to be overcome, and no one is as positive attitude-wise as you. Go for it Sag!"}, {"text": "Just because someone in a position of authority is critical of what you are up to does not mean you should stop. On the contrary, the planets suggest they are worried that you might make a success of it \u2013 and they\u2019re right, you will, so keep at it."}, {"text": "Try to laugh at what happens today, even though on a surface level it may seem very serious indeed. When you get down to it life is not meant to make you suffer, so look adversity in the eye and smile. Think happy and you\u2019ll be happy."}, {"text": "You are advised to make a conscious effort to focus on facts only today and avoid wishful thinking. Also, take what the so-called experts tell you with a large pinch of salt. They are just as likely to be in dreamland as you are!"}, {"text": "The planets warn you could get a bit too possessive about something this year. Whatever that something happens to be you will need to keep reminding yourself that the tighter you hold on to it the more likely it is you will lose it."}, {"text": "This should be an extremely fortunate time for you and whatever minor obstacles you may encounter along the way you will easily find ways to handle them. The planets are very much on your side now, so show the world what you can do."}, {"text": "The sun in the wealth area of your chart means there is a good chance you will enjoy some sort of windfall over the next few weeks, but you must not let that stop you from making an effort yourself. Strive more to earn more."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you leave partners, loved ones and relatives in no doubt how you feel about them \u2013 and, of course, you feel only good things. You can never say those two little words \u201cI love you\u201d too often or too loud."}, {"text": "Be careful what you allow yourself to think over the next 24 hours because your imagination is so powerful that you could easily create a reality for yourself that may not be what you truly desire. Control your mind, don\u2019t let it control you."}, {"text": "Cosmic activity in your fellow fire sign of Sagittarius makes it easy for you to persuade those you live, work and do business with that you know what you are doing and that they should join you in doing it too. You can be so persuasive Leo."}, {"text": "There are some strong emotions in play at the moment and if you are not very careful you could get swept away by them. You need to remember that as a Virgo your greatest strength is your rational way of looking at the world."}, {"text": "Chances are you will say some pretty outrageous things over the next few days but that\u2019s okay \u2013 in fact it\u2019s good. You will express yourself with such conviction that no one will dare disagree with you. You\u2019ll benefit, and so will they."}, {"text": "You must not let others persuade you that you need to buy certain things to keep up with the latest fads and fashions. Don\u2019t waste your money on trinkets you don\u2019t need and quite possibly will never even use. Be strong enough to say \u201cNo\u201d."}, {"text": "No effort is too much for you now and whatever goal it is you are working towards will soon be within reach. You don\u2019t have to go it alone though. If you join forces with like-minded people you\u2019ll be moving mountains in a matter of days."}, {"text": "You will know instinctively today if what you are being told is on the level, and chances are your sixth sense will warn it\u2019s a lie. You are under no obligation to believe what others say \u2013 your only obligation is to protect yourself."}, {"text": "This is a great time for reaching out to people you may not have been in contact with for a while. Pick up the phone or send them an e-mail and make it clear you want to get together again. It\u2019s time to renew a beautiful friendship."}, {"text": "Differences of opinion over creative issues are likely over the coming year but on this occasion tension is likely to be beneficial in that it will open your mind to new ideas and new ways of looking at the world. As for your heart, love will sweep you away!"}, {"text": "You have never been the shy and retiring sort but as Mercury moves back into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart you may not be as communicative as you usually are. That\u2019s okay, even an Aries is allowed a quiet day occasionally."}, {"text": "If you need to get in someone\u2019s good books now is the time to speak up and let them know who you are and what you can do. But you must be honest about it. Don\u2019t exaggerate your talents because they will be checking up on you."}, {"text": "You know you have what it takes to succeed but some people may need convincing. Find ways to persuade partners and colleagues and employers to take you more seriously this weekend. And remember that actions count for more than words."}, {"text": "Go your own way, do your own thing and don\u2019t waste even a second wondering what the rest of the world might think about it. Even if a lot of people don\u2019t like it the fact is there is nothing much they can do about it, so get busy."}, {"text": "Some unexpected news will land in your inbox today, but the fact is you should have seen it coming a long time ago. Most likely you were so involved in your own fantasy world that you failed to notice what the real world was up to."}, {"text": "Someone you are close to emotionally is starting to feel a bit neglected, so your main aim this weekend must be to reassure them that they are still in your thoughts and, more importantly, still in your heart. What can you do to convince them?"}, {"text": "According to the planets you have overlooked a small but extremely important detail and the effects of that oversight will become apparent over the next 48 hours. The sooner you realize you have made a mistake the sooner you can remedy it."}, {"text": "You may be secretive by nature but as communications planet moves back into your sign today you can and you must let people know what you are up to. It won\u2019t have any effect on your long-term plans, at least not in a negative way."}, {"text": "Doubts and fears that have been plaguing you in recent days will all but disappear over the next 48 hours and that\u2019s good. Maybe you should ask yourself how and why you allowed your mind to get so worked up over what now appears to be nothing."}, {"text": "Put principle before profit this weekend and don\u2019t waste time worrying about how you are going to make ends meet. Yes, times may be tough financially but you stand a much better chance of pulling through if you stay calm. Panic could be disastrous."}, {"text": "The planets indicate you will have to make a difficult choice concerning your career this weekend. The situation isn\u2019t new but, having tried to ignore and avoid it for so long, you will find there is no place left for you to hide. It\u2019s time to decide."}, {"text": "Forget about all the doubts and fears that have been going through your mind over the past few days and do what feels right to you personally. You\u2019ve listened to all shades of opinion and now it is up to you to act \u2013 quickly and decisively."}, {"text": "You may not want to be in the spotlight but it\u2019s quite likely that you will be over the coming year, and for good reasons. The fact is a lot of people look at you as some sort of role model, so be the best you can be at all times."}, {"text": "Enjoy yourself while you can, because you never know what tomorrow might bring. That, in a nutshell, is the message of the stars for you today Aries and, yes, it\u2019s a cosmic invitation to go out and have a good time. But get some work done too!"}, {"text": "If you expect good things to happen over the next few days they surely will. As Jupiter, planet of plenty, moves into one of the better areas of your chart today you can be sure that Lady Luck is smiling on you. Don\u2019t forget to smile back."}, {"text": "Someone you think of as a rival may surprise you today by doing something that helps you out, and without even being asked. Proof, if proof were needed, that most people are actually quite pleasant, no matter how they sometimes act on the outside."}, {"text": "You may be right to believe that someone you have work or business dealings with has been using questionable methods but keep those suspicions to yourself for the time being. Chances are they will slip up over the next two or three days."}, {"text": "You may like to think that this is the time to make your big move, and you may be right, but you also need to keep an eye on what other people are doing. Could their actions counteract your own? If so, think again about your timing."}, {"text": "Someone seems determined to drive a wedge between you and a group of people you usually get along with. Don\u2019t let them. Just carry on as you are and ignore them as if they do not exist. It\u2019s only by reacting that you give them power."}, {"text": "You like to win but over the next few days you will have to accept that coming second, or even third, is the most you can hope for. Remember, it\u2019s not about whether you win or lose but how you play the game, and Libra\u2019s middle name is Fairness."}, {"text": "You have been on a profitable run for some time and with Jupiter, planet of good fortune, moving into one of the better areas of your chart today that run will continue for some time yet. Don\u2019t forget to spread around a little of what you gain."}, {"text": "Just because you are good at multitasking does not mean you have to do it and the planets suggest you should do just one thing at a time today. The fewer tasks you have on the go the more those tasks will reward you. It\u2019s good business."}, {"text": "For too long you have feared the worst, but now that Jupiter is moving into your sign, where it will stay for about a year, you can sense that your luck has turned for the better. Put doubts and anxieties behind you and move forward with supreme self-belief."}, {"text": "Ignore other people\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d and focus only on the facts as the new week begins. Anything of an emotional nature is best avoided for a while, so be logical in everything you do and interact with the world on a common sense level. It\u2019s not difficult."}, {"text": "It might be easy to blame other people for the situation you find yourself in but you know that would not be fair. You are as much to blame as anyone else, so accept responsibility and then take charge. Only one thing needs to change and that\u2019s your choices."}, {"text": "A sun-Mars link on your birthday will boost your energy levels and make success more likely, but there is a danger you will spread yourself too thin and not accomplish half as much as you should have. Be selective. Focus on two or three aims only."}, {"text": "Today\u2019s sun-Mars link will encourage you to call it as you see it no matter how many people might complain that you are being too critical. Make sure that what you say is based squarely on fact, otherwise your enemies will enjoy making you look bad."}, {"text": "Your attitude toward a certain person will harden today and no matter how much others say you should be more forgiving, you will find it difficult to let them off the hook. You\u2019re in no mood to give anyone the benefit of the doubt."}, {"text": "Make an effort to spell out in plain and simple language what it is you are about to do. That way misunderstandings are less likely to occur. On the other hand, don\u2019t give too much away. Be open about your long-term aims but stay vague about the details."}, {"text": "You need to let certain people know that you were not put on this Earth to do their bidding. As you have allowed them to take liberties for so long it won\u2019t be easy but if you don\u2019t get tough now you may never break free."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t lack for confidence today and will be eager to make changes both at home and at work. But you need to make sure those changes are fully understood by the people who will be most affected. You have some explaining to do."}, {"text": "You need to let partners and loved ones know why you have taken a certain course of action. They may not agree with what you have done but they will appreciate the fact that you made an effort to explain yourself \u2013 and that\u2019s half the battle."}, {"text": "Friends and relatives will give you whatever it is you most desire today. Whether or not it is good for you remains to be seen but your powers of persuasion are such that no one will deny you. Can you have too much of a good thing?"}, {"text": "The people you have to deal with today don\u2019t want flattery, they want facts, so make sure you know what is going on and make sure you are on top of whatever situation it is you are involved with. Don\u2019t just look professional Scorpio, be professional."}, {"text": "You have put off doing something you should have taken care of a long time ago far too many times already. Now you must get your act together and get on to it straight away. It won\u2019t be half as tedious as you feared \u2013 IF you start now."}, {"text": "You may not be able to escape your fears altogether but you don\u2019t have to let them get on top of you. Make a conscious effort to remind yourself how lucky you are and how many new opportunities are coming your way \u2013 dozens of them!"}, {"text": "If you can\u2019t handle a task on your own today don\u2019t be afraid to ask for assistance. Friends and work colleagues will rally round if you ask them to but they can\u2019t read your mind, so speak up and let them know you are struggling."}, {"text": "Mars in your sign at odds with the sun in the career area of your chart means it\u2019s quite likely you will clash with someone in a position of power. Try not to go over the top in word or deed but don\u2019t back down either. Be strong."}, {"text": "Changes will come thick and fast over the next 12 months and it will be a rare day indeed when nothing much happens. The good news is you will love every minute of it. You\u2019ve never been one to settle for the easy life."}, {"text": "Yes, of course, some of the people you have to deal with get on your nerves, but no matter what they might say or do you must not let personal feelings get in the way of your professional responsibilities. Rise above pettiness Aries."}, {"text": "You must pace yourself sensibly today, because if you try to force things you may end up doing yourself some harm. If you don\u2019t have the energy or the inclination to do a certain task, then don\u2019t do it. No one can make you, can they!"}, {"text": "This is a good day for all kinds of communication, so let others know what you are up to and what they can do to assist you. Chances are they will be only too happy to help, so they can bask in the glow of your success."}, {"text": "No matter how many things you may have on the go at the moment you must still find time to take care of the needs of the people who love you. You may be intensely ambitious but on this occasion your ambitions can wait."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t seem to be taking life too seriously at the moment and that\u2019s good. Do whatever takes your fancy over the next 24 hours, no matter how trivial it may seem to other people. There is always something to laugh about."}, {"text": "Something will happen today that throws your plans into confusion. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that on this occasion chaos will most likely be creative. You need to get out of a rut Virgo and today\u2019s events will assist you."}, {"text": "You seem to be in one of those moods when whatever other people say you delight in taking the opposite viewpoint. It might be fun but watch out you don\u2019t make an enemy of someone it might have been better to keep on your side."}, {"text": "Anyone who tries to take liberties with your generous nature today will learn very quickly just how dangerous that can be. That applies especially to your working environment, where you have no time for people who don\u2019t pull their weight."}, {"text": "You must be at the centre of what\u2019s going on, even if it risks damaging your reputation. Usually it\u2019s other people who are warned not to get too close to you but today it\u2019s the other way around \u2013 you need to be careful who you befriend."}, {"text": "The planets are urging you to pull out all the stops and show what you can do. But what you do must be done by the rule book. If you try to cut corners it won\u2019t work and, worse, your reputation for straight dealing could suffer."}, {"text": "Can you trust what a friend has to tell you? You want to, of course, but there\u2019s a nagging feeling in the back of your brain that they might be telling you lies, even if for the best of reasons. Find out what\u2019s really going on."}, {"text": "Something unsettling will occur today, something that throws your plans up in the air, and you will have to act quickly to regain control of the situation. Hold on tight because it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride, though quite probably an enjoyable one too."}, {"text": "A sun-Neptune link on your birthday will do wonders for your imaginative powers but it could also lead you down some rather strange roads. By all means explore the outer limits but make sure you know how to get back to home base!"}, {"text": "Do whatever it takes to avoid petty arguments today, because you will need all your energy to strive for an important goal that is now within reach. What you accomplish over the next few days will set the scene for the many months."}, {"text": "The planets make it pretty clear that you have bitten off more than you can chew, that your talents don\u2019t quite match up to the challenges you face. Don\u2019t get angry with yourself about it though \u2013 all experience is good experience."}, {"text": "You must stick to the facts today, even if the facts are nowhere near as exciting as you would like them to be. If you try to insert wishful thinking into what you are doing the results could be embarrassing for all concerned."}, {"text": "Try to avoid arguments today, both at home and at work, because they are unlikely to be resolved in your favour, if indeed they are resolved at all. You need to find ways to work with partners and colleagues, ways that benefit everyone."}, {"text": "With the sun, your ruler, at odds with Neptune, planet of illusion, you may find it hard to distinguish between fact and fiction. Don\u2019t be surprised if something you thought was quite substantial turns out to have no substance at all."}, {"text": "Listen to what partners and loved ones have to tell you today but think carefully before you act on what they say. In fact you are strongly advised to hold off making any kind of decision while Neptune is so strong in your chart."}, {"text": "You can\u2019t seem to make up your mind as to what you should believe and what you should be doing. But who says you have to make a decision about either one of them right now? Take your time. Tomorrow will be here soon enough."}, {"text": "You may be eager to test your ideas but don\u2019t be so eager that you go off too early and make a silly mistake. Money matters, in particular, need to be handled with care over the next 24 hours. Don\u2019t put at risk what you cannot afford to lose."}, {"text": "You may have big plans, and they may be good plans, but the planets warn you must not rush things. The best time to launch a new project is when the moon is new on Friday. Until then, keep your head down and keep thinking."}, {"text": "Chances are you will find it hard to think straight today, and doubts and fears that would not worry you in the slightest most of the time will suddenly seem of huge importance. They\u2019re not, so get a grip on yourself and get past them."}, {"text": "You may disagree with what a friend or family member has to tell you but there is no point making a big fuss about it because they have clearly made up their mind. Maybe they\u2019re right, maybe you are being too cautious for your own good."}, {"text": "According to the planets you are expecting far too much of yourself and need to adjust your sights so you are aiming for goals you have some chance of reaching. You have nothing to prove Pisces, either to yourself or to other people."}, {"text": "Can you trust what your thoughts tell you? That is a question you have asked many times in the past but as mind planet Mercury moves in your favour on your birthday this year the answer has to be a resounding \u201cYes\u201d. Listen to your inner voice."}, {"text": "You seem to be under the impression that life is conspiring against you and that you are not getting the breaks you deserve. That isn\u2019t remotely true, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and do what is needed to bring a smile back to your face."}, {"text": "What happens today may be challenging but you are up to the task and won\u2019t rest until you have shown the world that you are not the sort to buckle under pressure. If others try to impose their will on you they are sure to regret it!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste time worrying about whether what you have chosen to do will be seen by others as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d because those moral judgments simply do not come into it. If it\u2019s what you need to happen then by definition that makes it right."}, {"text": "As Mercury moves in your favour again today chances are something pretty good will occur. Creative and artistic endeavours are under excellent stars at the moment, so follow your dream and don\u2019t stop just because others cannot keep up with you."}, {"text": "You will learn a lot about a friend today \u2013 maybe more than you really wanted to know! Be that as it may it will help you make sense of some of the things they say and do. If only they could make sense of you as easily!"}, {"text": "The more you are on the move today the more likely it is you will learn something to your benefit. Fate in its wisdom is about to bring into your life someone who will help you look at the world from a completely different angle. Enjoy the view!"}, {"text": "Mind planet Mercury turns direct today after one of its retrograde phases, which with any luck will open your mind to ideas that previously you never knew existed. Whatever your age may be it\u2019s never too late to learn something new about life."}, {"text": "In recent weeks you may have felt powerless against forces that were simply too strong for you to oppose but over the next 24 hours you will begin to see ways to start winning again. Brain power beats brawn power every time."}, {"text": "You won\u2019t hesitate to ride to the rescue of someone in need today and your selfless attitude will not go unnoticed. But if you really want to make a difference in the world you should join forces with those who share your concerns."}, {"text": "Your aims and ambitions have changed in various ways of late and as mind planet Mercury moves in your favor today they will most likely change again between now and the end of the week. You may end up back where you started!"}, {"text": "Some of the things you used to be passionate about no longer interest you the way they once did, but that\u2019s okay. Everyone changes over time \u2013 yes, even someone like you whose outlook is fixed \u2013 and you can sense it\u2019s time to change again."}, {"text": "What you think you believe will change over the next two or three days and you may be surprised to find that some of your new viewpoints clash with who you think you are. This is a wonderful chance to reinvent yourself Pisces. Don\u2019t waste it."}, {"text": "A new moon on your birthday promises that no matter how many false starts there have been in your life up until now this time you will get it right and go all the way. Expect the best over the coming 12 months and you will undoubtedly get it."}, {"text": "Try something different today, something you will be praised for if you get it right and criticized for if you get it wrong. A new moon in the most adventurous area of your chart means this is no time to play it safe. Go for it Aries!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t pull your punches today \u2013 let everyone know exactly what you think and feel and why you expect them to adapt themselves to you rather than the other way round. Be positive and expect to get your own way \u2013 and you will."}, {"text": "Because the new moon takes place in your opposite sign you will have to do what other people want to do rather than what you want to do. The good news is you will love every moment of it. You don\u2019t have to be in charge every day."}, {"text": "You will get through twice your usual workload today \u2013 you seem to have limitless energy. That\u2019s great but don\u2019t think you can do this much every day of the week because you can\u2019t. Reward yourself with some \u201cme time\u201d tomorrow. "}, {"text": "Today\u2019s new moon falls in the most dynamic area of your chart, so start something big and special and expect it to be a resounding success. Also, affairs of the heart are very much looking up at the moment. Who deserves your love most? "}, {"text": "You can be rather critical at times, and often with good reason, but today you should put your negative thoughts on hold and make a conscious effort to help those around you accomplish their goals. Their success will be your success too."}, {"text": "You will find it incredibly easy to get what you want today. Friends, family members and even strangers will treat your requests as demands and be only too happy to carry them out. It won\u2019t always be this good Libra, so make the most of it!"}, {"text": "Start a new project today, maybe one you have been thinking about for ages but for one reason or another have still not got round to doing. Don\u2019t worry how much it might cost to start with \u2013 ultimately it will make you a handsome profit."}, {"text": "What would you do if you knew you could not fail? So do it. Now. A new moon in your sign makes this the perfect time to ignore whatever limitations you may have imposed on yourself and go all out for glory. You won\u2019t regret it."}, {"text": "The planets warn you may go too far today but the good news is it won\u2019t do you any harm, and may even improve your standing with those who thought you were too cautious to put your reputation on the line. Go all out for glory."}, {"text": "You can be amazingly persuasive when you are in the mood and you will be very much in the mood today. Anyone who thinks they are immune to your charms will find out that what an Aquarius wants an Aquarius invariably gets."}, {"text": "According to the planets you are negotiating from a position of strength and don\u2019t have to give ground to anyone. Ignore those who say you need to meet them halfway because you don\u2019t \u2013 they adapt to your needs or they miss out."}, {"text": "Focus on the things that mean most to you personally and don\u2019t worry that some people may feel left out in the cold. There is only so much you can do for friends and family members \u2013 but you can, and should, do more for yourself."}, {"text": "The atmosphere on the home front may be a bit strained this weekend but there is no need to worry because the negativity will disappear as quickly as it arrived. Whatever happens, keep the smile on your face \u2013 it makes life so much easier."}, {"text": "Other people can afford to let their emotions get the better of them but you cannot. No matter what happens over the next 48 hours you must stay calm and you must think logically in all situations. Someone needs to keep a clear head."}, {"text": "If you get the chance to spend some time on your own this weekend you must take it. You may be happy-go-lucky and sociable by nature but even a Gemini needs to give themselves room to think about serious matters once in a while."}, {"text": "You seem to have a knack for knowing what is going on, even when there isn\u2019t much evidence to point you in the right direction. Part of the reason is that you read other people\u2019s body language so well. But what is your body language telling them?"}, {"text": "You will see or hear something to your advantage this weekend and you must use it to get ahead of your rivals, either at work or in competition for someone\u2019s affections. They say all is fair in love and war, so take no prisoners Leo!"}, {"text": "The message of the stars for Virgos everywhere this weekend is that they must question everything they hear. Just because someone in a position of authority makes a claim of some kind does not mean it is true. Check the facts for yourself."}, {"text": "You may be tempted to give up on a project that is boring you to tears but if you do you will regret it later on when you look back and realize that some good would have come of it eventually. Stick with it a while longer."}, {"text": "You may get a thrill from sticking your nose in other people\u2019s affairs but watch out they don\u2019t turn the tables and start investigating what you get up to in your private life. You do, after all, have secrets you would prefer the world not to know."}, {"text": "The moon\u2019s eclipse of Saturn this weekend warns you must not take chances with money, especially your own. If you get a spur of the moment insight into how to make a fortune you would be wise to wait a day or two before committing yourself."}, {"text": "You find it easy enough to forgive other people their mistakes, so why can\u2019t you forgive your own? With the moon eclipsing your ruler Saturn there is a danger you will be much too hard on yourself. Accept you are human like everyone else."}, {"text": "New information will come your way this weekend and because it contradicts what you already believe you may have a hard time coming to terms with it. Sooner or later though you will have to make room for it in your philosophy of life."}, {"text": "By all means let friends and family members know what you think about their activities but don\u2019t be too negative about it. What sounds like constructive criticism to you may seem destructive to them. Build up their confidence, don\u2019t knock it down."}, {"text": "Your way with words will be of benefit to you over the coming 12 months, not only in your career and in doing business but in relationships of a more personal nature. Don\u2019t be afraid to let others know what you are feeling \u2013 they will appreciate it."}, {"text": "A part of your mind already has the answers you need and if you stop your internal chatter for an hour or two today those answers will come through loud and clear. Don\u2019t listen to the so-called \u201cexperts\u201d, listen to what you already know deep inside."}, {"text": "Something you see or hear today will prompt you to face up to a fear you have tried to forget about for quite some time. Once you have admitted to yourself that it worries you it will be easier to seek advice and assistance from other people."}, {"text": "As Mercury, your ruler, moves into your opposite sign today you should find it easier to talk to people on a one-to-one level. Don\u2019t just talk to those you get along with, try talking to those who annoy you too \u2013 they also have stories to tell."}, {"text": "You desperately need to find ways to reduce your workload and what happens today will give you some ideas. But an idea on its own is not enough \u2013 you have to take that idea and make it work for you, without adding to your workload of course!"}, {"text": "There is something about you at the moment that other people find irresistible. Everyone wants to know you. Everyone wants to be your friend. It\u2019s nice to be popular but don\u2019t let it inflate your ego too much. You\u2019re still human like the rest of us."}, {"text": "If your instincts tell you that someone is not to be trusted then you must act on that inner information. You may want to believe that they would never betray you but you cannot afford to take the chance \u2013 and will probably regret it if you do."}, {"text": "Your head may be full of great ideas but what are you going to do with them all? You need to recognize that most of those ideas will never come to anything, but that one or two of them could change the world. Think quality rather than quantity."}, {"text": "You make your own luck in life. Yes, of course, some people are born into more comfortable circumstances than others but you still have the power to change things in almost any way you desire. Identify the \u201cyou\u201d you really want to be, and then become it."}, {"text": "As mind planet Mercury moves into your sign today good ideas will come at you from every direction. Give yourself permission to explore any and all possibilities that come to mind, even the ones that some people say should not be allowed."}, {"text": "You have a knack for noticing things that most other people are completely unaware of, and that talent will come in useful today. At the very least you will see the danger in a situation that looks harmless \u2013 enabling you to keep yourself at a safe distance."}, {"text": "Mercury\u2019s change of signs today will inspire you to think \u201coutside the box\u201d and come up with answers to questions that most people prefer to avoid. Your insights, and your ingenuity in applying them, will rightly make you look like some kind of genius."}, {"text": "There are so many variables in your world at the moment that it simply isn\u2019t possible to make the kind of predictions you can trust. If others demand to know what you think is going on just tell them you are as much in the dark as they are."}, {"text": "The more contacts you make over the coming year the more opportunities there will be to move your career in a direction that could bring the kind of job satisfaction you need to be happy. It\u2019s time to start moving up in the world."}, {"text": "You will need to make a hugely important decision over the next few days and you must get it right. Find a quiet place where you won\u2019t be disturbed and give the issue some serious thought. People are counting on you, so don\u2019t let them down."}, {"text": "You cannot be expected to make an even-handed decision about a situation where your own financial interests are at stake, and anyone who thinks you will is deluding themselves. Do what is best for you and don\u2019t feel in the least bit guilty about it."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry about what other people might think of what you say and do. If you go over the top in word or deed and offend colleagues or friends, well, that\u2019s just the way it is. If you watch every word you say you\u2019ll never get much said!"}, {"text": "You can be a bit gullible at times, especially when faced with someone who knows how to push your emotional buttons. The planets warn you must check everything you are told today \u2013 then check a second and a third time just to be sure."}, {"text": "It would appear that you are seriously thinking about giving up on something that you can\u2019t get to work. Since when have you been such a quitter? Resolve here and now to redouble your efforts and see it through. You WILL win in the end."}, {"text": "You will need to make allowances over the next 24 hours for people who do not possess your levels of intelligence and skill. Not everyone can be a Virgo \u2013 it\u2019s a very special calling \u2013 so accept that some people are going to fall behind."}, {"text": "Yes, it may be the case that you are being a bit too cautious at the moment, but if your sixth sense tells you to tread carefully you must not ignore it. Time is very much on your side over the coming week, so there\u2019s no need to rush."}, {"text": "Someone will make you a tempting offer either today or tomorrow but you must not commit yourself just yet. The planets indicate if you play hard to get they can most likely be persuaded to turn their good offer into a great one."}, {"text": "Sometimes even a Sagittarius needs to be alone with their thoughts and this is clearly one of those times. A few days from now, when Mercury moves into your birth sign, you will be back to your talkative best. Until then, stay silent."}, {"text": "If you owe someone a favour then you must find a way to repay it over the next two or three days. You may have other things on your plate at the moment but this is a debt you don\u2019t want to be tied to for too long."}, {"text": "In your hurry to impress someone you could take on too much today and look silly when you have to admit you are not up to the job. Even an Aquarius has limits and if you are not sure what yours are you need to find out quickly."}, {"text": "You must tell the truth today, even if it risks hurting the feelings of people you love and respect. It will hurt them a lot more in the long-term if they discover that what you have been saying and what you have been doing are two very different things."}, {"text": "No, you have not missed your chance. No, life has not passed you by. On the contrary, your birthday chart indicates that the biggest opportunities are still to come. No matter your age or current position you are about to make a very big splash!"}, {"text": "Ignore the critics and do only what feels right to you. You are under no obligation to change your ways just to suit other people. And next time it might be wise to keep your plans to yourself so you don\u2019t attract so much negative attention."}, {"text": "You seem to be worrying more than you should about money matters, but if you slow down and think rationally about your financial situation you will realize it could be a lot worse. Yes, it could be a lot better as well, but overall you\u2019re doing fine."}, {"text": "You may think you know what makes a friend tick but they will say or do something today that takes you by surprise. It would seem there is still quite a bit about them you don\u2019t know or understand. Finding out about it could be fun!"}, {"text": "The sun may be transiting the most hard-working area of your chart at the moment but don\u2019t try to do everything yourself. The best way to get things done is to spread the load among friends and colleagues. What can you offer them by way of reward?"}, {"text": "You certainly don\u2019t lack for confidence at the moment but you will need to balance it with plenty of common sense over the next 24 hours. Also, if your sixth sense tells you that someone is not to be trusted you must not ignore it."}, {"text": "Minor disagreements could easily get out of hand over the next two or three days, so promise yourself now that you won\u2019t get worked up about issues that are of no real importance. Which, when you think about it, means just about everything."}, {"text": "Yes, you can blame someone else for the mistakes they have made but if you are honest you will blame yourself, too. They were, after all, operating under your instructions. Libra is a cardinal sign, which means you must take responsibility."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t waste your hard-earned cash on things you don\u2019t really need, no matter how shiny and bright they may look. It\u2019s up to you what you do with your money, of course, but you\u2019ll kick yourself later if you squander your resources now."}, {"text": "Your energy levels are at an all-time high but you still can\u2019t decide what you should be doing with it. Chances are you are thinking about it too hard and your thoughts are getting in the way of inspiration, which comes from the heart. Relax and just be."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not unusual for you to feel a bit fearful at this time of year and you probably won\u2019t be able to relax until the sun enters your sign on the 21st. Between now and then think only pleasant thoughts and ignore all the rest."}, {"text": "You may have to be blunt with a friend or family member today but it is for their own good. Don\u2019t just tell them where they have been going wrong, show them how they can improve and get it right next time. They\u2019ll thank you for it."}, {"text": "Everyone seems to be running in a dozen directions at the moment but you are under no obligation to join them. You work best when in calm surroundings, so move as far away from the mayhem as you can and get your thoughts in order."}, {"text": "There will be any number of times this year when you speak without thinking about what you are going to say. But that\u2019s not a bad thing \u2013 on the contrary it means that your words come from the heart, which is why they will have such a positive effect."}, {"text": "You may believe with all your heart that something needs to be changed but not everyone is going to agree with you, so be ready for criticism. Of course, if you really are convinced you are right you should be able to convince other people too."}, {"text": "It may appear as if you are out of favour with certain people, but according to the planets you are taking too negative a view of the situation. Just because you have fallen out over something minor does not mean it\u2019s the end of the world."}, {"text": "You will soon get the chance to make progress in a creative endeavour that is close to your heart, but don\u2019t get carried away and think it is all downhill from here on in because there is a lot of work to be done. Get someone to help you."}, {"text": "It would appear that someone is trying to undermine your confidence but they can only succeed if you let them. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to reject everything you hear that makes you feel uneasy. Chances are you have very little to worry about."}, {"text": "Your likes and dislikes are clear for all to see \u2013 you see no point in disguising them \u2013 but your honesty could have a downside in that now your rivals know where your weak spots are. Don\u2019t give away any further information about yourself."}, {"text": "As Mercury, your ruling planet, moves back into the domestic area of your chart today you will have to use your wisdom and experience to solve problems for loved ones. You enjoy helping them, of course, but don\u2019t let it become a habit."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t say too much and tip off your rivals about what you are planning. Cosmic activity in the most open and outgoing area of your chart makes you want to shout and sing but it is possible to talk too much you know. Think before you speak."}, {"text": "Only you know what it is you want out of life and therefore only you can decide what your ambitions should be. By all means listen to advice from a friend but if it doesn\u2019t quite fit with what your heart tells you then feel free to ignore it."}, {"text": "Mercury, planet of communication, enters your sign today, so you won\u2019t be shy about telling people what you think. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter entirely but you won\u2019t really care. You just like the sound of your own voice!"}, {"text": "You will be taking on more responsibilities between now and the turn of the year, which may not be what you were hoping to hear but there\u2019s good news too. Those responsibilities will lead to opportunities, the kind very few people are fortunate enough to get."}, {"text": "Something a friend tells you today may make you wonder if you have taken a wrong turning but don\u2019t worry, you haven\u2019t. Just because a certain course of action worked for them does not mean it would work for you. Follow your own star, it\u2019s still shining bright."}, {"text": "As mind planet Mercury joins the sun and Jupiter in the career area of your chart today you should start thinking seriously about what you want to achieve in 2019. Don\u2019t wait for New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 make some major resolutions right now."}, {"text": "Your energy levels will run high over the coming 12 months and you must find a creative outlet for them. What is it that ignites your passions the most? Devote yourself to it 100 per cent and get ready to change the world."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks they know how your mind works will get it wrong today as you do the opposite to what they predicted. Whether you do it for a reason or just to annoy them is not important \u2013 what matters is they don\u2019t take you for granted."}, {"text": "The best things in life are free \u2013 true or false? What happens over the next three or four days will surely convince you that, yes, there are some things worth having that you don\u2019t have to pay for, at least not in the financial sense."}, {"text": "There seems to be some tension in your dealings with other people lately, no doubt caused by so much cosmic activity in your opposite sign. But tension can be creative, especially if you can find ways to use it to get things done."}, {"text": "Something has knocked you off your stride and you are finding it hard to get your rhythm back. But don\u2019t worry. According to the planets what is frustrating you so much now will actually help you later on. You\u2019ll soon be back in the groove."}, {"text": "There is nothing you cannot handle. No challenge is too much for you. In fact, if you are in any way typical of your sign you will seek out situations that test you. You don\u2019t need to prove yourself but you will \u2013 you enjoy being competitive."}, {"text": "If someone annoys you between now and the weekend your best response by far is to just turn your back and walk away. The fact is they want you to react in a negative way so they can use it as an excuse to criticize and undermine you."}, {"text": "You will be asked to give your opinion today on a subject you don\u2019t know much about and if you are smart you will tell everyone that your knowledge is limited and you are not the best person to ask. They will admire your honesty."}, {"text": "Put your own needs first today and don\u2019t worry if some people might see that as a sign of a selfish nature. Maybe it is but you are under no obligation to do things for other people that you know they would never do for you."}, {"text": "The sun and Jupiter in your sign endows you with so much confidence in yourself that others will look at you, and what you attempt to do, with something approaching awe. Let them know you don\u2019t want to be hero worshipped \u2013 just obeyed!"}, {"text": "By all means help someone in need today but don\u2019t stop there \u2013 find ways to help people on a more general and impersonal level. Sign up for a charity or some other kind of organization that devotes itself to good works. You\u2019ll be glad you did."}, {"text": "Stop dreaming about what you would like to do and actually start doing it. Your dreams may seem a bit far-fetched at the moment but once you get working on them you will realize you have what it takes to make them come true. Be bold!"}, {"text": "Do other people\u2019s achievements inspire you or do they make you envious? Actually it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 it could in fact be both \u2013 because the important thing is it gives you something to aim for. Some day soon others will be envious of you!"}, {"text": "A sudden attraction is likely over the next month or so and to begin with at least you will have to keep your feelings to yourself. Later on though you will get the chance to be more open about what is in your heart. That\u2019s when the fun starts!"}, {"text": "If anyone tries to force you to move in a direction you don\u2019t want to go today they will very soon regret it. They obviously don\u2019t know you too well if they think they can bark orders or pull rank and be allowed to get away with it!"}, {"text": "Go your own way and do your own thing over the next 24 hours and don\u2019t worry in the slightest if some people disapprove of your actions. The very fact that you are getting a reaction suggest that you are on the right track."}, {"text": "You may be desperate to get rid of certain of restrictions but the harder you try to free yourself the more tightly they seem to bind you. Maybe you should take the hint and stop trying so hard. If you relax you may be able to wriggle free."}, {"text": "A dispute or disagreement of some kind is probably best avoided but according to the planets you are in one of those moods when you just cannot keep quiet. Once you have got involved though you must go all the way. It\u2019s all or nothing."}, {"text": "You need to change your way of doing things and be a bit more adventurous. Once you start down a new path you may be surprised to find you have talents you never knew existed. But they\u2019re there now, plain as day, so use them."}, {"text": "Everything will work out in the end, so there is no need to get uptight about your current situation. You may be under the impression that no matter what you say or do friends and family will ignore you \u2013 but they need you and they know it."}, {"text": "A major upheaval will take place over the next few days and because you generally prefer things to stay as they are you probably won\u2019t be happy about it. Be that as it may it will bring in its wake wonderful opportunities. Don\u2019t miss them!"}, {"text": "Someone wants to repay you for all the kindness you have shown them. It\u2019s not necessary, of course, but if they go out of their way to do something for you today you must go out of your way to show how grateful you are. It\u2019s good manners."}, {"text": "If others know what is good for them they won\u2019t try to stand in your way when you tell them that you are going to be moving in a new direction. Hopefully they know from experience that it\u2019s foolish (maybe even painful) to try to dissuade you."}, {"text": "No matter how many times you have failed in the past you will succeed in the very near future, but you need to be patient. The sun is slowly but surely coming to the end of its annual cycle and will be back in your sign again very soon."}, {"text": "You will need to be ruthless with yourself today and over the weekend, because you cannot afford to have doubts. A lot needs to be done and most likely in a short space of time as well, so get your head together and get on with it."}, {"text": "You need to make a decision and you need to stick with it come what may. Yes, of course, some people will say you have got it wrong, and maybe they\u2019re right, but the only thing that matters is that you see it through to the end."}, {"text": "You may prefer to act first and think about what you have done later \u2013 maybe \u2013 but the message of your birthday chart this year is that you need to reflect on what you are going to do before you actually do it. It will make a big difference."}, {"text": "You may be in two minds about what you should be doing this weekend but you need to get your act together and make a quick decision because if you wait too long you could lose out financially and professionally. You\u2019re an Aries \u2013 so be first."}, {"text": "If you start something new this weekend you must accept that it is going to take up quite a bit of time and energy. Maybe you should have another think about it first. Is it worth that level of investment? Decide, then act."}, {"text": "You may not want to do what other people want to do over the next 48 hours but the planets suggest it would be a good idea to go along with their plans. A few days from now it could be you who needs their support in return."}, {"text": "Life is too short to worry what the world might think of you, so decide what it is you want to do and then just get on and do it. If people who don\u2019t understand your needs and desires have an issue with it that\u2019s their problem, not yours."}, {"text": "Try not to get dragged into a dispute between friends this weekend. Even if you get involved out of good intentions you will either make an enemy of one side or, worse, have them both turn against you. Keep your distance."}, {"text": "Anyone who thinks they are tough enough to take you on will soon learn the error of their ways. Your head knows what you want and your heart will give you the desire to go out and get it. Others get in your way at their peril."}, {"text": "The only thing that matters now is that you stay loyal to people who have been loyal to you in the past. A positive link between Venus, your ruler, and Saturn, planet of responsibility, encourages you to make sacrifices for them."}, {"text": "Not everything in life has to be logical. Sometimes things happen for no obvious reason and you just have to accept it. That is very much the situation for you at the moment, so use your intuition rather than your intellect this weekend."}, {"text": "You will take risks purely for the fun of it over the next 48 hours. Whether you win or lose does not matter, it\u2019s the taking part that means something. Most likely you will win though \u2013 your fire sign energy will see you cross the finishing line first."}, {"text": "You\u2019ve done a great deal of thinking and planning in recent weeks and it won\u2019t be long before you can move to the next stage and put those ideas and plans into effect. This weekend though you must take it easy. Conserve your energy for later."}, {"text": "If you try something you have never done before this weekend the results could be spectacular. Yes, it\u2019s true, they could also be spectacularly disappointing, but life is about taking risks and both enjoying the successes and learning from the failures."}, {"text": "The pressure is very much on at the moment but that\u2019s okay because you are determined to show people in positions of power that you are more than just a pretty face. Be selective about the tasks you agree to take on though. Don\u2019t exhaust yourself."}, {"text": "The most important thing now is that you get your thoughts organized. Too often in the past you have allowed your mind to wander all over the place but you cannot afford to do that any more. A tidy mind could lead to some very tidy profits over the coming year."}, {"text": "Someone you are close to emotionally is keeping things from you, which is of course worrying, but most likely they have a very good reason for it. It\u2019s far too early to get uptight about it, so relax and see how the situation plays itself out."}, {"text": "A positive frame of mind is a must, so don\u2019t let doubts creep in. If they do they are likely to multiply quickly and before you know it you will think the whole world is against you. What is your favourite inspirational saying? Repeat it often today."}, {"text": "You can at times be a bit too easily provoked and someone could play on that fact today and try to get you to say things you later regret. Promise yourself now that you won\u2019t fall for their games and tricks, no matter how hard they try."}, {"text": "Your workload seems to be getting out of hand and you fear if you don\u2019t get on top of it soon it could ruin the festive season for you. Do something about it today but don\u2019t set yourself ridiculous targets. Maybe you are worrying for no good reason."}, {"text": "You may be inclined to give up on something that is taking up too much of your time and energy but don\u2019t throw in the towel just yet. What occurs over the next 24 hours could help you in ways you had not expected. The universe wants you to succeed."}, {"text": "Ignore any gossip you might hear today because almost certainly there is very little truth in it. Also, while it might be fun to talk about someone behind their back you never know where it might lead, especially if they find out and blame you."}, {"text": "A friend needs your assistance and, of course, you will do what you can. Don\u2019t wait to be asked \u2013 their situation is so bad that you don\u2019t have time to talk about it first. Just do what needs to be done and, most likely, save them from themselves."}, {"text": "Yes, you have spent too much money, but there is not much point worrying about it. What\u2019s done is done and cannot be undone \u2013 but before you reach for your wallet again ask yourself if you really need what you are proposing to buy. Probably not."}, {"text": "If what someone offers you today sounds too good to be true then you must find out what strings may be attached. Most likely what they want in return is worth it to you but you cannot just assume that is so. Do your homework, then make a decision."}, {"text": "There is something in the back of your mind that is worrying you to such an extent that you find it hard to focus on anything else. Make time today to confront it. It may not be pleasant but you need to get past the worry and deal with the issue."}, {"text": "Some people may say you are aiming too high or getting ideas above your station, and maybe they are right, but ignore them anyway. You create your own luck, so go all out to get what you desire and challenge your rivals to stop you if they can."}, {"text": "A lot of things have happened over the past few weeks and there is still a lot to take in and digest, so give yourself some breathing space. You need to find some quiet time to consider what has been done, and what you may need to do next."}, {"text": "A Mars-Pluto link on your birthday will give you the courage you need to meet the kind of challenges that might destroy lesser individuals. Not only will you not be destroyed but you will actually grow stronger. Challenges are good for you."}, {"text": "It might be wise to keep a low profile during the first few days of the week, then come out of your shell when the sun links with Uranus in your sign on Thursday. Most of the things you have been worrying about exist entirely inside your head."}, {"text": "Good things will come your way this week and by the time the sun moves in your favour on Friday you will believe that life is worth living again. Just don\u2019t go from one extreme to the other and start acting as if the good times will never end."}, {"text": "This is the ideal time to make an impression on people in positions of authority, especially on the work front where, if you make more of an effort, your talents are sure to be recognized. But don\u2019t promise more than you know you can deliver."}, {"text": "Co-operation is the key to success as the week begins and if you can put aside any personal animosities, you might have with colleagues there is every chance you will accomplish a lot together. You don\u2019t have to like people to be able to work with them."}, {"text": "Try not to be too possessive about what you own and earn today because the planets warn that could lead to conflict with people who have a claim on at least some of your resources. Give others what they need and you will get what you need too."}, {"text": "You are on the cusp of one of the most positive times of the year but between now and Friday, when the sun moves in your favour, you must get your home life in order. You won\u2019t have time for petty squabbles later, so sort them out now."}, {"text": "Mars in the area of your chart that governs your daily routines will pile on the pressure today and you may wonder how you are going to get everything done. You\u2019ll find a way \u2013 you always do. You\u2019re at your best when the heat is on."}, {"text": "You must aim high this week. The planets warn you will never forgive yourself if you waste good opportunities because you were not entirely sure you had what it takes to make the most of them. You don\u2019t have to be sure, you just have to act!"}, {"text": "It might annoy you that some of the people you have to deal with act more with their hearts than with their heads but that\u2019s just the way it is. Not everyone can be as rational as you, so make allowances. Keep your cool and be a good example."}, {"text": "Words will come easy to you today \u2013 maybe a bit too easy for some people\u2019s tastes! Mars in the communications area of your chart means you tend to speak first and worry about what you have said later \u2013 if at all. Not everyone appreciates that."}, {"text": "You need to make sure that your financial affairs are in order before you move on to other matters. Toward the end of the week, when the sun changes signs, you will have more pressing issues to worry about, so sort out your cash-flow situation now."}, {"text": "If you want to start something new it won\u2019t be long before you get the chance, but if you want it to be a success you must not work alone. Anything is possible this week if you join forces with people who share your outlook and your ambitions."}, {"text": "You need to get your head round the fact that if you are going to make something of your life you must learn from other people. Pick a role model whose successes inspire you and aim to be even better than they are this year."}, {"text": "This is a good time for thinking but not such a good time for doing. Whatever ideas come into your mind over the next 24 hours you will probably have second thoughts about them later in the week, so don\u2019t commit yourself just yet."}, {"text": "You may be looking for excuses not to start something that\u2019s got to be done but the planets indicate you have no choice in the matter: You made a promise and now you must keep it. Next time don\u2019t be so eager to help other people."}, {"text": "Most likely you will say something shocking today, just to see the look on other people\u2019s faces. Yes, of course, it\u2019s a lot of fun but it could also be dangerous if the wrong people get to hear about it. Be ready for a backlash."}, {"text": "You don\u2019t need to listen to other people\u2019s advice \u2013 you need to listen to your instincts. It may be that what others have to tell you today has some validity but what really matters is what you know in your heart to be true. Trust yourself Cancer."}, {"text": "Just because a so-called expert points you in a certain direction does not mean it is the direction you have to travel. You possess both a mind of your own and the gift of free will. Put the two together and see where they take you."}, {"text": "You may disagree with what a friend has to tell you today but according to the planets they know what they are talking about, so don\u2019t dismiss their concerns out of hand. If you act on what they say it could save you a lot of money."}, {"text": "You may disagree strongly with what a friend or family member does today but don\u2019t make a big deal of it. Chances are they are acting this way because they want to draw attention to themselves. You are under no obligation to play their silly games."}, {"text": "Social activities should be a lot of fun over the next two or three days but watch your cash-flow situation because you could easily go too far and spend more than you can afford. Just because you feel rich does not mean you are rich!"}, {"text": "A friend will tell you something about yourself today and chances are you won\u2019t like it, because it\u2019s true. It\u2019s one thing to believe in yourself and be super confident but it doesn\u2019t hurt to get some outside assistance too. Learn from what they say."}, {"text": "Be careful what you wish for today because there is every chance you will get it, and every chance you won\u2019t want it once it is in your possession. You\u2019re no stranger to responsibility, but some responsibilities are simply not worth having."}, {"text": "You may be asked to give up something you treasure over the next two or three days and you are advised to at least think about it. Obviously, there is some sort of trade to be made and maybe what you receive will be better than what you give."}, {"text": "Avoid going to extremes today, not just in what you do but in what you say as well. If your words upset someone at work they may hold a grudge against you that causes all sorts of problems. Say nice things only, even if you don\u2019t really mean them."}, {"text": "You always seem to be looking ahead, planning for what you are going to do next week, next month and next year. The universe invites you to drop that approach and live in the moment instead. Experience joy today, don\u2019t postpone it until tomorrow."}, {"text": "Your mind may be sharp and clear but that is no guarantee you will reach the right conclusions about an issue that has been bothering you. A lot depends on whether the facts and figures you are working with can be trusted. Check them carefully."}, {"text": "You can, if you wish, rush through a task quickly to get it out of the way but the planets warn if you do you may have to come back to it later and do it all over again. Take your time and get it right the first time."}, {"text": "By all means plan ahead but don\u2019t look so far ahead that you lose sight of what you should be doing right now. Yes, tomorrow is important, but what happens today is the foundation on which everything that is to come must be built."}, {"text": "You seem to be having doubts about something that only a short time ago you thought was a fantastic idea, but you must not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 give up on it yet. Come the end of the week it will be a fantastic idea all over again."}, {"text": "Because you are desperate to make an impression you will do just about anything to get those around you to sit up and take notice. That\u2019s fine, but make sure you stay on the right side of the law, or the impression you make won\u2019t be a good one."}, {"text": "If someone asks you to get more personally involved with a cause that is close to your heart by all means agree to do so. But make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for. It could turn out to be a full-time commitment."}, {"text": "Someone you believed you could trust has been keeping things from you and you can no longer deny that fact. Don\u2019t get too angry with them though because they may have done you a favor. You will certainly be more careful in future."}, {"text": "If you find it hard to communicate with a friend or loved one today it simply means this is not a good time to discuss serious subjects. Stick to light-hearted exchanges over the next 24 hours \u2013 the kind of stuff you can laugh at together."}, {"text": "If someone in a position of authority says something that seems to cast doubts on your expertise you must confront them about it. You cannot allow your reputation to be called into question, not when there is still so much at stake."}, {"text": "You may not be in one of your more sociable moods at the moment but in a way that\u2019s good because it will give you the time and space you need to think about your next move and how you are going to make your dreams come true."}, {"text": "Let friends and family members know what it is you intend to do today so there can be no misunderstandings. If you keep your plans to yourself and then get it wrong you will invite all sorts of criticism, most of it well deserved."}, {"text": "The important thing now is that you know your own mind and have no fear in moving in whatever direction it points you. Don\u2019t listen to the doubters and cynics \u2013 the more opposition you get the more likely it is you are on the right track."}, {"text": "You will be of a mind to do something outrageous this year \u2013 such is the influence of Uranus on your birthday \u2013 but other influences warn you must not allow yourself to get carried away. Work out how far you can go without turning the world against you."}, {"text": "You seem to be in one of your hypergenerous moods \u2013 you will do anything for anyone with no questions asked. Just be careful you don\u2019t end up doing everything for other people and nothing for yourself. You deserve the good things in life too."}, {"text": "Try not to get too excited about a financial opportunity of some kind because the planets warn what you gain today you could just as easily lose tomorrow.

It\u2019s good that you are so passionate about life but you can and you must keep those passions under control."}, {"text": "Aim to do something today that you do not enjoy. Why? Because it will get you up and about and active, and the earlier in the week you are getting things done the easier the period between now and the new year will be.

The world is big enough for multiple viewpoints."}, {"text": "It\u2019s all about you at the moment. With so much cosmic activity in your sign you can\u2019t help but be at the centre of things, and that will increase tenfold over the next few days.

If you make an effort to understand where they are coming from you may be able to find ways you can move ahead together."}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you go where you can be seen over the next few days. The more you are in the spotlight the more opportunities will come your way and the more likely it is you will break through to the big time in 2020."}, {"text": "Resolve on your birthday to take a more positive attitude to the world around you. Yes, there are bad things going on and, of course, it\u2019s natural to get annoyed about it all, but if you want to make a d\u00ad\u00ad\u00adifference a smile will do more than a frown."}, {"text": "Be careful what words you use today because if you say something that a loved one finds offensive it could cast a dark cloud over the holidays. You may have every right to be critical but that doesn\u2019t mean you HAVE to speak up."}, {"text": "Try not to go to extremes over the next few days, because if you go too far or say too much you could create an enemy of someone it might have been wiser to keep on your side. Follow a moderate, middle-of-the-road course at all times."}, {"text": "You may be the kind of person who likes to shock but as others are hoping for a peaceful day this is clearly not the right time to do something outrageous. Wear a bright red suit and a big white beard if you must, but draw the line there."}, {"text": "An upheaval of some kind is likely over the next few days and the planets indicate there is nothing you can do about it. Sit back, enjoy the ride and get ready to take advantage of the situation. Crises always throw up new opportunities."}, {"text": "Work and health matters are now uppermost in your mind and if you have been overdoing it of late you must now go to the other extreme and finds ways to relax. That means switching off completely, at least for a while."}, {"text": "Now that the sun is moving in your favour again you may be tempted to take the kind of chances you usually go out of your way to avoid. And why shouldn\u2019t you? Life is for living, so get out there and make your presence known."}, {"text": "Some people say that challenges are just opportunities in disguise and you will get the chance to find out if that is true today.

Get up and get out into the world and meet them halfway. The time to bide your time is well and truly over. Make things happen!"}, {"text": "Don\u2019t be too concerned if something important goes out of your life today because the cosmic powers that be will soon replace it with something many times better. You need to create some space that the universe can rush in and fill."}, {"text": "The sun is in your sign, the world is on your side and there is a gleam in your eye again. What could possibly go wrong? Almost nothing, is the answer to that one \u2013 so get your act together and do something big and beautiful and brilliant."}, {"text": "Someone is playing on your emotions in an effort to make you feel bad about what you have done.

Whatever you did \u2013 or maybe did not do \u2013 it\u2019s merely a turning point \u2013 learn from it and move on to the next thing."}, {"text": "You may have to make special arrangements over the holiday period to keep certain people apart, or at least keep a buffer zone between them. The sad fact is that not all your friends want to be friends with each other. That\u2019s life."}, {"text": "A Mercury-Neptune link on your birthday means your mind will come up with all sorts of weird and wonderful ideas over the coming year. If you can find creative and constructive outlets for them you might just be the next big thing!"}, {"text": "Why are you wasting time trying to make sense of something that clearly makes no sense at all? Maybe it\u2019s your desire to understand the world around you, or maybe it\u2019s your need to control it, but either way you won\u2019t succeed. Just enjoy it."}, {"text": "The consequences of something you did earlier in 2018 will catch up with you between now and the end of the year. Should you be worried? Of course not. Almost certainly your deeds were good and the consequences will be beneficial."}, {"text": "You may feel confident that fate is taking you in the right direction but you need to apply that confidence in practical ways. What can you do to improve not only your own life but the lives of those around you? Get on and do it!"}, {"text": "Anyone who tries to spoil your holiday fun by telling you what you should believe and how you should behave is going to wish they had kept their mouth shut. You are in no mood for lectures. You just want to enjoy yourself."}, {"text": "What you need to keep in mind at all times is that nothing truly happens by chance \u2013 there is always a web of cause and effect that leads you, and everyone else, to where they are at a particular moment in time. Wherever you are now, enjoy it!"}, {"text": "Do you know what you are aiming for in life? Do you have an overall goal that you are working toward? If you do, that\u2019s great, keep at it. If you don\u2019t, you need to sit yourself down and decide what it should be. Everyone needs a purpose."}, {"text": "A few days or weeks from now you will look back and wonder how and why you got so worked up about something that in the greater scheme of things is so trivial. You can, if you wish, stop getting worked up about it right now."}, {"text": "You possess the ability to turn almost any situation to your advantage now \u2013 all it takes is self-belief and the desire to change the world for the better. Remember though that charity begins at home \u2013 take care of yourself and your people first."}, {"text": "If you have not managed to get everything done that you wanted to get done, don\u2019t fret about it. Tomorrow is another day and, in just a few days, it will be another year as well, so set your sights on the future and have fun today."}, {"text": "You must tell the truth about a difficult situation, even if you fear it could hurt someone\u2019s feelings. They will find out what\u2019s going on sooner or later, so you might as well be honest about it now. Besides, lying, even for a good cause, is still wrong.

Everyone gets it wrong once in a while \u2013 yes, even Aquarius \u2013 and it\u2019s good to remind yourself that you are human like everyone else. But better, of course."}, {"text": "Stop working so hard Pisces. As the old year draws to a close you need to slow down and enjoy more of the simple things that life has to offer. Also, if you end the year in a mad rush it won\u2019t be a good omen for next year."}, {"text": "You probably won\u2019t get as much support from friends and family members as you would like over the coming 12 months but maybe that\u2019s no bad thing. You need to learn to trust your own ideas and insights. You don\u2019t need anyone to hold your hand."}, {"text": "Try not to let a minor difference of opinion escalate into a war of words today. It would be a shame to allow what has so far been a great holiday period take a turn for the worse. Do what you can to keep the atmosphere lighthearted."}, {"text": "If you make life difficult for someone today chances are they will make life difficult for you later on and, on balance, you will come off worse. You won\u2019t get anywhere by being overly aggressive. Try to help people rather than hinder them."}, {"text": "You may be convinced that you know best but that does not mean other people are going to follow your lead. Nor is there any reason why they should. Maybe later on you can say \u201cI told you so\u201d but for now, let them do as they please."}, {"text": "Don\u2019t worry if people you can usually rely on to support you seem a bit indifferent to what is going on in your life. Most likely they have their own issues that need to be dealt with first. On this occasion why don\u2019t you assist them?"}, {"text": "Just because the sun is moving through one of the more cautious areas of your chart does not mean you cannot take risks or have fun. On the contrary, today\u2019s cosmic influences make it easy for you to test your limits and put on a show."}, {"text": "It\u2019s not like you to get emotional about things you cannot influence or change but you have allowed yourself to get irritated with a group of people whose attitudes you don\u2019t much like. Ignore them. Pretend they don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s the only way."}, {"text": "You will find plenty to laugh about over the next 24 hours and the really good news is you will be laughing with other people rather than at them. The absurdity of the world and its worries is enough to bring a smile to anyone\u2019s face!"}, {"text": "If you must take risks with money today make sure you have some kind of get-out clause. According to the planets, it\u2019s not a good time to gamble, at least not with your own cash. Keep your money in your pocket \u2013 you don\u2019t have to make a profit."}, {"text": "You may get a bit irritated with someone who does not seem to share your energy and enthusiasm but don\u2019t let it show. In fact, ask yourself this: Is it them who is being slow and dragging their feet or is it you who is being impulsive?"}, {"text": "Go where your passions take you today and enjoy them to the full without feeling guilty. The sun in your sign makes you want to dance and sing, and why on earth should you deny yourself? It\u2019s the time of year to have fun after all!"}, {"text": "Do your own thing in your own way over the next 24 hours and, if certain people make it plain they don\u2019t much like it, then do it some more! If you allow them to restrain you in any way you are sure to regret it later on."}, {"text": "Be careful when dealing with people above you in the pecking order, like employers and senior colleagues. If they think your attitude is too flippant they may hold it against you further down the line. Pretend to be serious, even if you don\u2019t feel it."}, {"text": "Jupiter and Saturn will see to it that both career and creative matters go well for you. What you think of today you will be experiencing tomorrow, so make sure your thoughts are positive, then a good year might even be a great one."}, {"text": "This could be one of those days when the more you try to do things one way, the more you end up doing them a completely different way. Maybe you should take the hint and go with the flow. You don\u2019t have to lead all the time, Aries."}, {"text": "Stop pretending that everything in your garden is rosy and set about pulling up some weeds. The planets make it easy for you now to end old things and start new things, so what are you waiting for? A brighter future is about to bloom."}, {"text": "You may be in the mood to do something dramatic today but the planets urge you to think carefully before you act. If you push too hard or too soon you could easily overreach yourself. Sometimes it\u2019s best not to act at all."}, {"text": "If a friend is in an argumentative mood today don\u2019t take it to heart: They are most likely having a bad time of things in certain areas and need to let off steam. Take it as a compliment that it\u2019s you they turned to first."}, {"text": "If you go to extremes over the next 24 hours it could cause problems in the early part of the new year. Maybe just this once you should err on the side of caution. Don\u2019t change methods and routines you\u2019ve grown used to over the years."}, {"text": "Do you follow your instincts or do you follow what someone who seems to know more about a situation than you do suggests? Only you can decide but chances are they actually know less than they claim, so maybe your instincts are safer."}, {"text": "Be ready to take advantage of changes on the work front and don\u2019t feel too sorry for a colleague who falls out of favour. Would they feel sorry for you if the roles were reversed? Of course they wouldn\u2019t. Their loss is your gain."}, {"text": "With so much cosmic activity working in your favour at the moment it may seem as if you just can\u2019t lose, but don\u2019t be so sure. Other aspects indicate you need to keep your wits about you, especially when dealing with authority figures."}, {"text": "It will pay you to reveal something about yourself today that you would prefer to keep private. By opening up about yourself you will encourage others to open up about what they have been doing \u2013 and what you learn may surprise you."}, {"text": "No matter how much certain people may threaten to derail your plans the simple fact is they are in no position to do so. With both the sun and Pluto in your sign it\u2019s you who has the power to make things happen, not them."}, {"text": "The only thing you need to remember today is that you have nothing to prove, not to other people and not even to yourself. You are who you are for a good cosmic reason, so be the best of who you are and what you can be."}, {"text": "You should be in a hugely positive mood now and if there are any lingering doubts they will surely disappear by the weekend. Don\u2019t overdo it and exhaust yourself though. Pace yourself sensibly and have just the right amount of fun every day."}, {"text": "What starts out as a friendship will develop into something deeper and stronger over the coming 12 months, and the power of your feelings may surprise you. Whether you realize it or not you have been looking for love \u2013 and love has been looking for you!"}, {"text": "Talk over your problems, be they personal, professional or financial, with someone you know will lend a sympathetic ear. You don\u2019t have to keep your worries and fears to yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a brave face. Open up a bit."}, {"text": "Is that the real you other people see? Or is it a mask you wear to protect yourself from the big bad world? Most likely it\u2019s the latter, which is a shame because the world isn\u2019t really as terrible as you think it is. Show your true face today."}, {"text": "Find ways to co-operate with people whose support you will need to make sure your work and business targets for the new year can be met. Use your way with words to convince them that you know what you are doing \u2013 even if you don\u2019t . . . yet!"}, {"text": "The planets warn you have become a bit too set in your ways and need to loosen up a bit, especially when dealing with people whose approach to life may be very different to your own. It takes all sorts to make such a wonderful world."}, {"text": "Concentrate on good things only today and don\u2019t waste your precious time on issues that are of no consequence and on people who can\u2019t seem to recognize what matters in life.

On the contrary, you know exactly what is going on and what you should be doing to assist. So do it!"}, {"text": "Your mind seems to be working harder than ever at the moment but you need to recognize that your mind, just like your body, can be pushed too far.

You\u2019ll need it."}, {"text": "What you own and earn is very much on your mind at the moment, and that\u2019s okay, but try not to see everything in terms of dollars and cents. Affairs of the heart, in particular, need your attention now \u2013 and true love costs nothing."}, {"text": "A few days from now a new year will begin but you don\u2019t have to wait until Jan. 1 to start making changes.

Whatever it is that inspires you most is what you should be putting your heart and soul into now. Give it 100 per cent at all times."}, {"text": "Try not to take life too seriously between now and the turn of the year. It may be that certain things could be better but you don\u2019t have to let that get you down. Life may not be a joke exactly but it\u2019s still worth a few laughs."}, {"text": "You need to be clear in your mind what it is you most want to accomplish over the coming 12 months. Don\u2019t look any further ahead than that because your long-term plans are sure to change, but in the mid-term you must be positive."}, {"text": "A new sense of urgency will seize you this year and the changes you make will be far from superficial. Pluto\u2019s influence on your birthday means you need to transform your existence in ways that may not seem possible now \u2013 but will be very soon."}, {"text": "The message of the stars for you this weekend is that you must know your limits and not go too far beyond them. By all means push yourself a bit but don\u2019t push so hard that failure becomes inevitable. Your ego won\u2019t like it."}, {"text": "You have been wasting far too much time and far too much energy on something that is not worth the effort. It\u2019s not a lost cause as such, but there are certainly better things you could be doing with your resources. Start doing them today."}, {"text": "Your plans may be detailed and brilliant but that does not mean they are guaranteed to succeed. According to the planets something is about occur that throws your plans in the air \u2013 and who knows how they will look when they land?"}, {"text": "You need to admit that a relationship is not working out as well as expected. Ask yourself if it can be saved and what changes you will need to make to encourage that to happen. Before then though, ask yourself: Is it worth it?"}, {"text": "It is of the utmost importance that you check the details of what you are about to do. If your planning has been too rough and ready then the results probably won\u2019t be to your liking. You cannot afford to be slapdash Leo \u2013 this is a serious matter."}, {"text": "You will get what you deserve over the next few days, nothing more and nothing less.

Get serious, stay serious and accomplish serious things in the world."}, {"text": "You may have to rethink some of your plans this weekend but that does not mean you have to give up on them completely. A few small changes here and a few small adjustments there could be enough to change your life in major ways."}, {"text": "Take a long, hard look at your money situation and decide what steps need to be taken to improve your earning power and long-term financial security.
